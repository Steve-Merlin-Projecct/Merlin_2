$TASK_DESC

IMPORTANT: After you receive this context, immediately read the .claude-task-context.md file to understand the full task details, then ask 1-3 clarifying questions to ensure you understand the scope and requirements before beginning implementation. Focus on:
1. Ambiguous requirements that need clarification
2. Technical decisions that aren't specified
3. Edge cases or error handling expectations
4. Integration points with existing code

Wait for user responses before starting implementation."
