# Template Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Original Issues (from FINDINGS_REPORT.md)

1. ‚ùå **Hardcoded values** - Company names, dates, degrees hardcoded in template
2. ‚ùå **Missing variables** - company_1, start_date_1, degree_1, graduation_date_1 not in template
3. ‚ùå **Position duplication** - position_1 appeared in both Job 1 and Job 2 headers
4. ‚ùå **Province/state variable** - User is Canadian, doesn't need province on resume
5. ‚ùå **Visible placeholders** - Unfilled variables showing in output

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed State/Province Variable ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```
<<street_address>>, <<city>>, <<state>> <<zip_code>>
```

**After:**
```
<<street_address>>, <<city>> <<zip_code>>
```

**Reason:** User is Canadian and doesn't want province displayed on resume.

### 2. Added Missing Company/Date Variables ‚úÖ

**Job 1 - Before:**
```
<<position_1>> | Contoso Bar and Grill | September 20XX ‚Äì <<end_date_1>>
```

**Job 1 - After:**
```
<<position_1>> | <<company_1>> | <<start_date_1>> ‚Äì <<end_date_1>>
```

**Job 2 - Before:**
```
<<position_1>> | <<company_2>> | June 20XX ‚Äì August 20XX
```

**Job 2 - After:**

```

**New Variables Added:**

- `<<start_date_2>>`
- `<<end_date_2>>`

---

### 3. Fixed Position Duplication ‚úÖ

**Before:** `<<position_1>>` appeared in both Job 1 and Job 2 headers

**After:**
- Job 1 uses `<<position_1>>`
- Job 2 uses `<<position_2>>`

---

### 4. Added Missing Education Variables ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```
B.S. in Business Administration | June 20XX | <<institution_1>>
A.A. in Hospitality Management | June 20XX | <<institution_1>>
```

**After:**
```
<<degree_1>> | <<graduation_date_1>> | <<institution_1>>, <<institution_city_1>>, <<institution_state_1>>
<<degree_2>> | <<graduation_date_2>> | <<institution_2>>, <<institution_city_2>>, <<institution_state_2>>
```

**New Variables Added:**

---

### 5. Added Missing Job Experience Variable ‚úÖ

**Before:** Hardcoded text in Job 2:
```
Grew customer based and increased restaurant social media accounts by 19%...
```

**After:**
```
<<job_2_experience_2>>
```

## Test Results Comparison

### Original Template Test
- **Template:** restaurant_manager_final.docx (broken)
- **Variables:** 43 total
- **Success:** 31/43 = 72%
- **Issues:** Hardcoded values, missing variables, position duplication

### Fixed Template Test
- **Template:** restaurant_manager_fixed.docx
- **Variables:** 47 total (+4 new variables)
- **Success:** 41/47 = 87.2%
- **Improvement:** +15.2 percentage points

### Remaining Placeholders (Expected)

The 6 remaining placeholders are **legitimate missing data**, not template issues:

1. `<<career_overview_4>>` - User's summary only has 3 sentences (needs 5)
2. `<<career_overview_5>>` - User's summary only has 3 sentences (needs 5)
3. `<<interest_5>>` - User only has 4 interests (template needs 6)
4. `<<interest_6>>` - User only has 4 interests (template needs 6)
5. `<<street_address>>` - User hasn't provided street address
6. `<<zip_code>>` - User hasn't provided postal code

**These are correct behaviors** - the template properly shows placeholders when data is missing.

## Data Mapping Improvements

### Career Overview Splitting

**Before:** Entire professional summary dumped into `career_overview_1`

**After:** Split into sentences:
```python
sentences = [s.strip() + '.' for s in prof_summary.split('.') if s.strip()]
for i in range(1, 6):
    mapped_data[f'career_overview_{i}'] = sentences[i-1] if i-1 < len(sentences) else ''
```

### Job 2 Experience from CSV

**Before:** No second job (Steve's JSON only had 1 job entry)

**After:** Extracted management experience from work history CSV:
- Position: "Event Manager & Beverage Operations Supervisor"
- Company: "Shambhala Music Festival"
- Dates: 2016-2019
- Created 4 experience bullets based on CSV roles
