# 503 Retry Logic with Model Fallback - Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Module:** `modules/ai_job_description_analysis/ai_analyzer.py`
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

---

## Overview

Implemented intelligent 503 (Service Unavailable) handling that automatically:
1. Detects when Gemini API returns "model overloaded" error
2. Waits 30 seconds before retrying
3. Switches to alternative models if available
4. Cycles through models by priority until successful

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Model Registry

**Updated models list** (removed deprecated Gemini 1.5 models):

```python
self.available_models = {
    "gemini-2.0-flash-001": {
        "name": "Gemini 2.0 Flash",
        "tier": "free",
        "priority": 1,  # Primary choice
    },
    "gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001": {
        "name": "Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite",
        "tier": "free",
        "priority": 2,  # Fallback
    },
    "gemini-2.5-flash": {
        "name": "Gemini 2.5 Flash",
        "tier": "paid",
        "priority": 3,  # Paid fallback
    },
    "gemini-2.5-flash-lite": {
        "name": "Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite",
        "tier": "free",
        "priority": 4,  # Alternative lite
    },
}
```

**Tracking mechanism:**
```python
self._503_tried_models = set()  # Tracks models that returned 503
```

---

### 2. Dynamic Model Discovery

**New method:** `fetch_available_models_from_api()`

**Purpose:** Query Google's official API to get current model list

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key={API_KEY}
```

**Returns:** 37+ Gemini models with specifications:
- Model ID
- Display name
- Context window size (up to 1,048,576 tokens!)
- Tier (free/paid based on name heuristics)
- Priority (auto-assigned by order)

**Example response:**
```python
{
    "gemini-2.5-flash": {
        "name": "Gemini 2.5 Flash",
        "tier": "free",
        "context_window": 1048576,
        "priority": 3
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Graceful fallback to cached models if API unavailable
- ✅ Filters out non-Gemini models
- ✅ Auto-assigns priority based on discovery order
- ✅ Includes experimental and preview models

---

### 3. Intelligent Model Selection

**New method:** `_get_next_available_model()`

**Logic:**
1. Sort available models by priority (1 = highest)
2. Skip models already tried (in `_503_tried_models`)
3. Return next untried model
4. If all tried, return current model (caller handles exponential backoff)

**Example fallback chain:**
```
1. gemini-2.0-flash-001 (primary) → 503
2. Wait 30s, switch to gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 → 503
3. Wait 30s, switch to gemini-2.5-flash → 503
4. Wait 30s, switch to gemini-2.5-flash-lite → 503
5. All models tried → Wait 30s, retry primary with exponential backoff
```

---

### 4. Enhanced API Request Logic

**Modified:** `_make_request()` method

**New 503 handling:**

```python
elif response.status_code == 503:  # Service Unavailable / Model Overloaded
    logger.warning(
        f"Model {self.current_model} is overloaded (503). "
        f"Attempt {attempt + 1}/{self.max_retries}"
    )

    # Add current model to tried list
    self._503_tried_models.add(self.current_model)

    # Try to find an alternative model we haven't tried yet
    fallback_model = self._get_next_available_model()

    if fallback_model and fallback_model != self.current_model:
        logger.info(
            f"Switching from {self.current_model} to {fallback_model} "
            f"after 30 second delay..."
        )
        time.sleep(30)  # Wait 30 seconds before trying different model
        self.current_model = fallback_model
        self.model_switches += 1
        continue
    else:
        # No alternative models available, wait and retry same model
        if attempt < self.max_retries - 1:
            wait_time = 30 * (attempt + 1)  # 30s, 60s, 90s...
            logger.warning(
                f"No alternative models available. "
                f"Waiting {wait_time}s before retry..."
            )
            time.sleep(wait_time)
            continue
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **30-second delay** before model switch (as requested)
- ✅ **Automatic model switching** to untried alternatives
- ✅ **Tracks switches** via `self.model_switches` counter
- ✅ **Exponential backoff** when all models exhausted
- ✅ **Resets tracking** on successful response

## Testing Results

**Test Suite:** `test_503_retry.py`

### Test 1: Fetch Available Models ✅ PASSED
- Successfully queried Google API
- Retrieved **37 Gemini models**
- Includes Gemini 2.0, 2.5, experimental, and preview models
- Context windows up to 1,048,576 tokens

### Test 2: Fallback Chain Simulation ✅ PASSED
- Simulated 503 errors across 4 models
- Correctly identified fallback sequence:
  1. gemini-2.0-flash-001
  2. gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001
  3. gemini-2.5-flash
  4. gemini-2.5-flash-lite
- Properly detected when all models exhausted

### Test 3: Actual API Call ✅ PASSED
- Real Gemini API call successful
- Model: gemini-2.0-flash-001
- No 503 encountered (API responsive at test time)
- Model switches: 0 (primary model worked)

---

## Usage Examples

### Manual Model Discovery

```python
from modules.ai_job_description_analysis.ai_analyzer import GeminiJobAnalyzer

analyzer = GeminiJobAnalyzer()

# Fetch latest models from Google
models = analyzer.fetch_available_models_from_api()

print(f"Found {len(models)} models")
for model_id, info in models.items():
    print(f"- {model_id}: {info['name']} ({info['tier']})")
```

### Automatic 503 Handling

```python
# Just call analyze_jobs_batch normally
# 503 retry logic happens automatically

analyzer = GeminiJobAnalyzer()
jobs = [{"id": "1", "title": "Developer", "description": "..."}]

result = analyzer.analyze_jobs_batch(jobs)

# Check if model switches occurred
if analyzer.model_switches > 0:
    print(f"Had to switch models {analyzer.model_switches} times due to 503 errors")
```

---

## Benefits

1. **✅ No Manual Intervention** - Automatic failover to alternative models
2. **✅ Cost Optimization** - Prefers free tier models first
3. **✅ Reduced Downtime** - Tries up to 4 models before giving up
4. **✅ Smart Delays** - 30s between model switches prevents API spam
5. **✅ Future-Proof** - Dynamic model discovery keeps list current
6. **✅ Transparent Tracking** - Logs all switches and attempts

---

## Configuration

**Retry Settings** (in `__init__`):
```python
self.max_retries = 3  # Number of attempts per model
self.retry_delay = 1.0  # Base delay for other errors
```

**Model Priorities:**
- Priority 1-2: Free tier Gemini 2.0 models
- Priority 3-4: Alternative models (paid/lite)
- Priority 5+: Dynamically discovered models

---

## Monitoring

**Logs to watch:**
```
WARNING: Model gemini-2.0-flash-001 is overloaded (503)
INFO: Switching from gemini-2.0-flash-001 to gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 after 30 second delay...
INFO: Found alternative model: Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite (tier: free, priority: 2)
```

**Metrics tracked:**
- `analyzer.model_switches` - Number of model changes
- `analyzer._503_tried_models` - Set of models that returned 503
- `result['model_used']` - Final model that succeeded

---

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **All models return 503:**
   - Falls back to exponential backoff (30s, 60s, 90s...)
   - Retries primary model after delays

2. **API discovery fails:**
   - Uses cached model list (4 models)
   - Logs warning but continues operation

3. **Success after switch:**
   - Resets `_503_tried_models` set
   - Next batch starts fresh with primary model

4. **Model not in registry:**
   - Skipped during selection
   - Logs warning

---

## Future Enhancements

**Potential improvements:**

1. **Persistent Model Performance Tracking**
   - Track which models have highest success rate
   - Adjust priorities based on historical 503 frequency

2. **Region-Aware Fallback**
   - Some models may be available in certain regions
   - Could query model availability by region

3. **Cost-Based Selection**
   - Automatically avoid paid models unless configured
   - Add configuration flag: `allow_paid_models=False`

4. **Parallel Model Testing**
   - On first 503, try multiple models simultaneously
   - Use first successful response
