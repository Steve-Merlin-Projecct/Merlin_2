# **What a Brand Strategist Is (and isn’t)**

* **Is:** The person who decides *what the brand must stand for* to win profitably, then architects how that meaning shows up in product, pricing, comms, design, and behavior. They align execs, brief creatives, and set the measurement model.

* **Isn’t:** A deck-factory, a “make it pretty” requester, or a social calendar planner. If you can’t tie strategy to **unit economics and market power**, it’s decoration.

# **Day-to-Day (the average week done well)**

1. **Discovery & Proof**

   * Stakeholder interviews; customer calls; store/UX ride-alongs.

   * Competitive/culture scan; social listening; reviews mining.

   * Light quant: survey design, basic stats, cohort and funnel pulls; baselining “share of search.”

2. **Synthesis & Choice**

   * Define the **jobs-to-be-done**, tensions, and non-customers.

   * Pick the **positioning** (what you’ll own \+ what you’ll sacrifice).

   * Draft **brand architecture** (masterbrand vs. subbrands).

3. **Narrative & Messaging**

   * Write the **one-sentence position**, 3 proof pillars, tone, claims.

   * Create a **messaging hierarchy** (corporate → product → feature).

4. **Creative Enablement**

   * Write tight **creative briefs** and review work against the strategy.

   * Translate strategy into **distinctive brand assets** (DBAs) to build.

5. **Go-to-Market & Governance**

   * Channel role map (brand vs. performance balance).

   * **Playbooks** and guardrails; name/tagline guidance; trademark checks.

6. **Measurement & Iteration**

   * Define **leading** (search, reach, mental availability) and **lagging** (pricing power, CAC, LTV, penetration) indicators.

   * Run tests; adjust narrative or assets; keep leadership honest.

# **Core Skills & Qualities (must-haves)**

**Thinking & Analysis**

* **Structured problem solving:** frame the market, define options, force trade-offs.

* **Consumer psychology & behavioral insight:** heuristics, category entry points, memory structures.

* **Research literacy:** qualitative (interviews, ethnography) and quantitative (surveys, MaxDiff/conjoint basics, segmentation logic). Comfortable with spreadsheets/SQL/BI for the 80/20.

* **Market math:** CAC/LTV, penetration vs. loyalty dynamics, margin sensitivity, ESOV logic.

**Craft**

* **Positioning & architecture:** clear, distinctive, *defensible*.

* **Messaging & writing:** ruthless clarity; concrete proof points; zero fluff.

* **Briefing & evaluation:** can steer creative without word-salad.

* **Visual literacy:** not a designer, but knows assets that travel (color, shape, characters, sonic cues) and how memory builds.

**Execution & Influence**

* **Facilitation & sell-in:** run workshops, align sharp elbows, de-risk choices.

* **Cross-functional fluency:** product, sales, CS, finance, legal/IP basics.

* **Governance:** guidelines people use; training; asset management; naming processes.

* **Temperament:** skeptical curiosity, ego-control, conviction with humility, resilience.

# **Stretch Goals (what the best in the world do)**

* **Make non-consensus bets that become consensus.** See a category truth early and commit (category design, not just positioning).

* **Tie brand to enterprise value.** Show how brand increases pricing power, reduces acquisition costs, and expands optionality (M\&A, distribution leverage).

* **Create cultural shorthand.** Memetic assets that travel without media spend (gestures, shapes, sonic mnemonics).

* **Institutionalize a brand operating system.** From hiring to roadmap to service scripts—brand is *how we decide*, not a PDF.

* **Forecast effect sizes.** Prioritize plays by expected impact on penetration and mental availability; defend the investment case like a CFO.

* **Room command.** Can flip a hostile exec room with a crisp model, a simple choice set, and evidence.

# **Practical Deliverables You Should Own**

* **Positioning one-pager:** who/when, promise, proof, reasons to believe, non-goals.

* **Brand architecture map:** masterbrand/subbrand rules, naming patterns.

* **Messaging matrix:** corporate → product → feature; by audience.

* **Distinctive Assets plan:** what to build, where to deploy, how to measure.

* **Creative brief template:** objective, constraint, single-minded message, do/don’t.

* **Measurement plan:** leading (reach, SoS, branded search, asset recall) and lagging (price premium, penetration, CAC/LTV, churn).

# **How to Judge a Brand Strategist (10-point rubric)**

Score 0–3 on each; if any are \<2, that’s your bottleneck.

1. **Clarity of problem framing**

2. **Quality of insight (not trivia)**

3. **Sharpness of choice/sacrifice**

4. **Defensibility/differentiation**

5. **Evidence & quant grounding**

6. **Messaging craft & coherence**

7. **Brief quality & creative outcomes**

8. **Cross-functional adoption**

9. **Governance that’s actually used**

10. **Measurement & commercial results**

# **KPI Starter Pack (make these visible)**

* **Leading:** category reach, **share of search**, unaided recall, asset recognition, % creative meeting asset-use standards.

* **Lagging:** price premium vs. peers, penetration growth, CAC trend, LTV uplift, sales volatility reduction in promo-off periods.

# **Common Failure Modes (avoid these traps)**

* **Trend-chasing** over truth. If TikTok defines your brand, your competitor owns your future.

* **Persona theater.** Over-segmentation, under-penetration.

* **Decks without decisions.** If your strategy doesn’t *kill options*, it isn’t a strategy.

* **Clever \> true.** Lines that win awards but don’t match product reality torch trust.

* **No measurement.** If you can’t point to price elasticity or CAC shifts, you’re guessing.

* **Inconsistent assets.** Constant “refreshes” reset memory; distinctiveness dies.

# **Up-level Fast: a 30-Day Plan**

**Week 1 – Audit & Baseline**

* Pull competitive claims/visuals; run a quick SoS scrape; talk to 5 customers & 5 non-customers; document current DBAs; list top 3 tensions.  
   **Week 2 – Choice & Message**

* Draft 2 positioning options with explicit sacrifices; pick one. Write a 1-sentence line \+ 3 proofs. Pressure-test with sales/CS.  
   **Week 3 – Enablement**

* Create a brief template; codify 3 DBAs to double-down on; write a channel role map (brand vs. performance split).  
   **Week 4 – Governance & Metrics**

* Draft a one-page guideline; define 5 KPIs; set an asset-use checklist for every creative delivery; schedule a 45-day review.

# **Tools (use, don’t worship)**

* **Research:** Typeform/Qualtrics, Lookback/Zoom for interviews.

* **Listening & reviews:** Reddit, G2, Amazon, app stores, TikTok comments.

* **Analysis:** Excel/Sheets, basic SQL, BI (Looker/GA4), text clustering.

* **Brand ops:** Figma for systems, Notion/Confluence for playbooks, DAM for assets.

# **If You’re Building Toward “Best in Class,” Practice These Reps**

* **Rewrite a cluttered positioning** into one sentence without losing meaning.

* **Run a pre-mortem** on your own strategy: “What would make this wrong?”

* **Force sacrifice:** list 3 things the brand will *not* talk about for 6 months.

* **Asset discipline:** pick one asset (shape/color/character) and push it into every touchpoint for 90 days—then measure recall.

* **Pricing rehearsal:** explain to finance how your plan earns a 2–5% price premium in 12 months. If you can’t, your plan is thin.
