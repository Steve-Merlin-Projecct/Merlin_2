# **What a strong Communications Specialist *must* be good at**

1. **Message architecture & positioning**  
    Build a simple, defensible narrative (problem → stakes → solution → proof → ask). Maintain a living “source of truth” anyone can reuse.

2. **Plain-language writing & ruthless editing**  
    Crisp headlines, active voice, one point per paragraph. Turns jargon into meaning. Knows when a press release is wrong tool.

3. **Audience & stakeholder analysis**  
    Maps who matters (customers, employees, media, policymakers, investors, community), what they fear/want, and which channels they actually trust.

4. **Channel orchestration**  
    Coordinates email, web, social, media, events, internal, exec comms so they ladder up to the same message—not seven competing ones.

5. **Media relations & issues spotting**  
    Maintains a targeted reporter list, pitches with news value, preps spokespeople, and flags risk language before it explodes on X/Reddit.

6. **Internal communications**  
    Keeps employees in the loop (and on-message) before the outside world hears. Writes for executives without becoming their stenographer.

7. **Crisis & incident communications**  
    Templates, approvals, roles, holding statements, and a rapid triage flow. Communicates facts, empathy, action, timeline—fast.

8. **Measurement that isn’t vanity**  
    Defines objectives and proof: awareness (share of voice, quality of coverage), trust (sentiment, survey deltas), behavior (traffic, trials, donations), risk (time-to-resolution). Stops reporting impressions like they’re impact.

9. **Content operations & governance**  
    Editorial calendar, approvals, versioning, and an asset library. Prevents random acts of content.

10. **Project management under deadline pressure**  
     Briefs, timelines, owners, risks, and trade-offs. Knows how to say “No, but here’s what we *can* ship by Friday.”

11. **Research & listening**  
     Rapid desk research, quick stakeholder interviews, and social/news monitoring. Uses evidence to kill pet ideas.

12. **Legal/ethical judgment**  
     Understands defamation, disclosure, data privacy, conflicts of interest, and accessibility. Doesn’t “spin” facts into lies.

13. **Visual literacy**  
     Can brief design/video well: hierarchy, readability, and data honesty. Knows when a chart misleads.

14. **Executive communications**  
     Speechwriting, talking points, investor letters, AMA prep. Pushes leaders to be specific and human.

15. **Tool fluency (typical stack)**  
     CMS \+ newsletter platform, media database/monitoring, social schedulers, analytics (web \+ social \+ brand tracking), project tools, and a basic AI toolkit for drafting and QA.

# **The day-to-day (average week, no fluff)**

* **Daily:** Monitor media/social, triage mentions/issues, write/edit (web post, email, internal note), prep talking points, update the editorial calendar.

* **Weekly:** Pitch media (2–5 targeted pitches \> 50 mass emails), ship one owned asset with a clear CTA, run an all-hands or manager brief, report a tight metric pack (what moved, why, next).

* **Monthly/Quarterly:** Own a campaign or moment (report launch, event, policy update), refresh message map, drill a crisis simulation, audit channel performance and cut what’s not working.

# **“Best in the world” stretch goals (the uncomfortable bar)**

1. **Narrative architecture at company scale** – Your message becomes how the CEO, sales, product, and HR talk—because it makes their jobs easier.

2. **Evidence-led persuasion** – You can defend claims with 3rd-party proof and original data (surveys, usage stats, case studies) and package it for reporters and policymakers.

3. **Crisis preemption** – You maintain a live risk register, run red-team scenarios quarterly, and have pre-approved language trees that cut response time to minutes.

4. **Attribution rigor** – You connect comms to pipeline, policy outcomes, or cost avoidance. Mixed-methods measurement \> dashboard screenshots.

5. **Cross-cultural and accessibility mastery** – Content that travels (linguistically and culturally) and meets WCAG—because anything else leaks trust.

6. **Executive shaping** – You coach leaders to say less, say it clearer, and own mistakes. You have the backbone to push back.

7. **Policy & regulatory literacy** – You can read a bill/standard and translate it into risk and message—without legal holding your hand.

8. **Coalition building** – Industry partners, NGOs, customers, and employees echo your message because you gave them a reason and assets.

9. **Experimentation muscle** – You test headlines, frames, and proof order; you publish the learning, not just the win.

10. **AI-accelerated workflows** – You use AI for first drafts, summarization, coverage coding, and scenario simulation—but you own taste, ethics, and final judgment.

11. **Data storytelling** – You turn raw tables into one chart that changes a room’s mind.

12. **Reputation capital management** – You can explain, with numbers, how today’s comms choices impact tomorrow’s negotiating power.

# **Common failure modes (and the fix)**

* **Press-release addiction.** Most releases are noise. Fix: publish owned insights, then pitch a tight, exclusive angle to *one* journalist who actually covers it.

* **Vanity metrics worship.** Impressions ≠ impact. Fix: tie activity to a behavioral KPI (signups, attendance, policy meeting set).

* **Message sprawl.** Every team invents copy. Fix: one living message map with examples and “do/don’t” phrases.

* **Reactive posture.** Always chasing the timeline. Fix: quarterly narrative themes, pre-built assets, and owned “moments” on the calendar.

* **Underpowered internal comms.** Employees hear news on Twitter. Fix: “internal first” rule; managers get toolkits 24 hours before external.

* **Legal paralysis or spin.** Either say nothing or say too much. Fix: pre-agreed disclosure tiers and approval SLAs.

# **How this differs from (and overlaps with) Brand Strategy**

* **Overlap:** audience insight, positioning, messaging, creative briefs.

* **Comms focus:** credibility, timing, stakeholder alignment, crisis/issue handling, measurement beyond marketing.

* **Brand focus:** segmentation, long-term identity and value proposition, portfolio architecture, creative platforms.

# **A quick competency ladder**

* **Associate:** clean copy, follow process, ship on time.

* **Specialist:** owns small campaigns, builds media list, drafts exec notes, tracks metrics.

* **Senior:** sets comms plans, manages issues, coaches spokespeople, proves impact.

* **Lead/Manager:** integrates across departments, runs crisis drills, shapes exec narrative, chooses what *not* to do.

* **Director/Head:** reputation strategy tied to business strategy; builds team, budget, and measurement framework.

# **What to look for (or show) in a portfolio/interview**

* A one-page **message map** with proof points and banned phrases.

* A campaign brief → shipped assets → outcome metrics (with what you’d change next time).

* A **crisis case**: holding statement, stakeholder matrix, timeline of updates, and post-mortem with lessons.

* Before/after examples of editing that cut 40–60% of words while improving meaning.

* Coverage quality analysis (not just quantity), and the exact pitch that earned it.

# **A no-nonsense 30/60/90 upskill plan**

**30 days:** Build the message map; run an audit of channels, coverage, and FAQs; draft crisis templates; set three non-vanity KPIs.  
 **60 days:** Ship an owned “insight asset” (original data/case study), secure 1–2 quality placements, implement internal-first cadence, and run one crisis simulation.  
 **90 days:** Publish a measurement memo linking comms to business outcomes; cut two low-yield activities; build a partner/advocate pack so others can echo the message.

## **Hard truths**

* If you can’t show how comms changed behavior or risk, you’re a cost center.

* If employees don’t believe you, neither will customers.

* Most “thought leadership” is generic. Without new evidence or a contrarian POV, it’s wallpaper.

* Speed beats polish in a crisis; facts and empathy beat both.
