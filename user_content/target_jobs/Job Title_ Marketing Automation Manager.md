# **Marketing Automation Manager — Expanded & Battle-Tested Job Profile**

## **Role purpose (single-sentence)**

Own the systems, data, and processes that turn marketing activity into repeatable, measurable pipeline and retention — by building robust automation architecture, enforcing data discipline, and partnering with content, sales, product and analytics to convert behaviour into revenue.

---

# **1\) What this job *actually* does (detailed responsibilities)**

### **Strategy & Governance (30%)**

* Define the automation strategy and roadmap aligned to revenue, retention, and funnel goals. Prioritize projects with ROI-driven scoring (impact × effort).

* Create governance: naming conventions, event taxonomy, campaign tagging, data access rules, SLA for campaign requests, change-control process (who approves what and how fast).

* Set ownership across teams (who owns contact state transitions, who owns event definitions).

### **Systems Architecture & Integrations (20%)**

* Architect and maintain the marketing automation platform (MAP) \+ CRM \+ CDP/data warehouse topology. Design canonical person and account objects and sync rules.

* Build scalable integrations (APIs, webhooks, ETL jobs, event streams). Own error handling, retry logic, and monitoring.

* Prevent tool-sprawl: evaluate new vendors against integration and data governance cost.

### **Campaigns & Workflow Engineering (20%)**

* Design workflow logic: segmentation, triggers, multi-step nurture sequences, rule-based personalization, AB tests, and transactional flows (onboarding, billing, re-engagement).

* Implement templates (email, landing pages), tests, and deployment pipelines. Ownership from design to live monitoring.

### **Data, Measurement & Optimization (15%)**

* Define KPIs, build dashboards, attribute outcomes to campaigns, and run experiments (A/B, holdout groups).

* Maintain data quality metrics (duplicates, stale records, invalid emails). Own reconciliation processes between MAP, CRM, and analytics.

* Implement and maintain lead scoring & routing logic.

### **Compliance, Security & Privacy (5%)**

* Ensure consent capture, unsubscribes, suppression lists, CASL/GDPR/CCPA processes are enforced. Work with legal on DSP/data retention rules.

### **Team Enablement & Documentation (10%)**

* Build runbooks, playbooks, onboarding docs, and training sessions for marketing \+ sales. Maintain a release calendar and campaign request intake form.

---

# **2\) Deliverables & concrete success metrics (KPIs — with definitions)**

Hard rule: every automation must map to 1–2 measurable outcomes.

Core KPIs (examples, pick those aligned to your company model):

* **Pipeline influence** — $ pipeline attributed to automated flows (last-touch or weighted model).

* **MQL → SQL conversion rate** — percent of MQLs from automation that convert to SQL.

* **Time-to-SQL** — median days from first touch to SQL for automated versus non-automated leads.

* **Campaign ROI / CAC impact** — revenue generated ÷ cost of the campaign (cost includes tool, creative, and people time).

* **Email deliverability** — delivery rate, spam complaint rate, bounce rate.

* **Data accuracy** — % of contacts with full canonical profile (email, name, company, job title, standardized company ID).

* **Automation uptime & errors** — number of failed workflows / month.

* **Retain/reactivate** — % of churned customers reactivated via automation flows.

* **Operational efficiency** — % reduction in manual campaign tasks or hours saved.

Include both leading (opens, clicks, conversion rate) and lagging (pipeline, revenue) metrics.

---

# **3\) The tech stack / primitives (what they must be fluent with)**

* Marketing Automation Platforms: HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot, Braze, Iterable (pick 1–2).

* CRM: Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Dynamics.

* CDP / Event layer: Segment / Rudder / custom event bus.

* Data warehouse & BI: BigQuery/Redshift/Snowflake \+ Looker/PowerBI/Tableau/Looker Studio.

* Integration tools: APIs, webhooks, middleware (Zapier/Make/Workato) — but prefer code/APIs for scale.

* Email delivery & IP management (SendGrid, SES, Postmark) and deliverability best practices.

* Basic SQL, comfortable reading query results and running quick checks.

* Familiarity with identity resolution, SSO, OAuth flows for app integrations.

---

# **4\) Tactical examples you can copy**

### **Sample lead-scoring pseudocode**

`score = 0`  
`if job_title in ['Director','VP','Head'] then score += 30`  
`score += clamp(company_employee_count / 100, 0, 20)   # scale company size to 0-20`  
`if visited_pages.contains('/pricing') within 14 days then score += 20`  
`score += 5 * email_opens_last_30_days`  
`score += 10 * demo_request_count_last_90_days`  
`# Thresholds`  
`if score >= 70 => route to Sales AEs`  
`if 40 <= score < 70 => send to SDR nurture queue`  
`else stay in marketing nurture`

**Calibration**: backtest against last 90 days of conversions; adjust weights to match a desirable hit rate (e.g., 15% SQL hit).

### **Common workflow blueprints**

* **New lead → Lead scoring → Immediate welcome email → Day-3 value drip → Day-14 product walkthrough → If score≥threshold route to SDR**

* **Free trial start → onboarding sequence with milestone triggers (login, feature use) → manual touch by success at churn-risk trigger**

* **Abandoned cart → 1h reminder → 24h with social proof → 72h discount if lifetime value predicted \> threshold**

* **Churn prevention**: detect 30-day inactivity → reactivation campaign with personalized content and special offer at 45 days.

# **5\) Operational playbook / launch QA checklist (copy/paste)**

Before you press “publish”:

1. Audience: confirm segment query includes/excludes correct lists.

2. Data: verify contact fields present & recently sync’d (email, consent flag, account ID).

3. Links: track UTM parameters, confirm landing pages exist and forms map to canonical fields.

4. Deliverability: seed list test (10 inbox providers) \+ spam-check.

5. A/B test plan: hypothesis, metric, sample size, duration.

6. Error handling: webhook retries, dead-letter queue configured.

7. Rollback: snapshot changes and create suppression rule to pause flow if errors.

8. Monitoring: set dashboard/watchlist \+ alert (Slack/email) for \>2% failure or spike in bounces.

9. Compliance: legal signoff for content and consent flows.

10. Post-launch: 48-hour health check and 30-day performance review scheduled.

---

# **6\) Org design & hiring recommendations**

### **Reporting lines (what works)**

* Best: reports to Head of Marketing or Director of Revenue Ops. Close partnership (matrix) with Sales Ops and Product.

* Team scale: Manager can start solo for SMB; for scale add 1 Automation Specialist \+ 1 Data Analyst \+ CRM Admin (or outsource some). At enterprise scale, create Marketing Ops \+ Revenue Ops split.

### **Seniority distinction**

* **Manager**: owns execution, integrations, runbooks, and small team coaching.

* **Sr Manager**: strategy ownership, complex account-based automation, vendor negotiation, 1–3 direct reports.

* **Director**: owner of cross-channel operations, budget, multi-region compliance.

---

# **7\) Candidate profile & screening rubric (practical)**

**Must-haves**

* 3–5+ years marketing automation / ops experience (or 2+ in enterprise).

* Hands-on with at least one MAP and one CRM.

* SQL-literate, comfortable with data warehouse outputs.

* Demonstrated experience building lead scoring and ROI-driven automations.

**Nice-to-haves**

* Dev familiarity (APIs, JSON), deliverability know-how, ABM tooling experience.

**Interview tasks (practical)**

1. **Audit exercise** (home task, 2–4 hours): give a sample MAP export and ask candidate to identify 10 issues and propose fixes. Score clarity of findings, depth of data checks, and prioritization.

2. **Design task** (30–60 min on call): design a nurture flow for a product launch, including metrics and rollback plan. Score on: outcomes-focused, edge-case thinking, testing plan.

3. **Technical QA**: ask candidate to write a SQL query that identifies duplicate emails or returns last touch event per contact (screen for basic correctness).

**Scoring rubric (0–3 scale per dimension)**

* Technical: MAP \+ CRM fluency (0–3)

* Data: SQL & analytics (0–3)

* Strategy: roadmap & KPIs (0–3)

* Communication: stakeholder handling & documentation (0–3)

* Ownership: runbooks, on-call, SLAs (0–3)  
   Target hire \= cumulative \>= 12 with no zeros in must-have areas.

---

# **8\) First 90 days plan (practical checklist)**

**Days 1–14: Intake & discovery**

* Meet stakeholders. Collect existing runbooks, calendar, audit history.

* Gain MAP & CRM admin access. Run data health check (duplicates, bounces, unsubs). Deliver a 2-page “Quick Audit” with 5 immediate fixes.

**Days 15–45: Quick wins**

* Fix 1–3 high-impact issues (e.g., broken zap/lead routing, duplicate lists, incorrect UTM mapping).

* Implement basic lead scoring and email seeding for deliverability.

* Create 1 dashboard (pipeline influence \+ deliverability \+ data accuracy).

**Days 46–90: Build & scale**

* Deploy 2 prioritized automations (onboarding \+ re-engagement) with test plans.

* Establish campaign QA, governance docs, release calendar and gating.

* Present 6-month roadmap and expected ROI to stakeholders.

---

# **9\) 12-month automation roadmap (quarterly themes)**

* Q1 — stabilize: data hygiene, naming, basic lead scoring, and governance.

* Q2 — conversion: prioritized nurture flows, ABM pilot, personalization templates.

* Q3 — scale: CDP sync, multi-channel orchestration (email \+ SMS \+ in-app), integrated attribution.

* Q4 — optimize & govern: holdouts & experimentation framework, migrate legacy flows and measure LTV impact.

---

# **10\) Budgeting & vendor management (how to not get burned)**

* Pricing traps: per-contact pricing escalates cost as hygiene worsens. Negotiate clean-up or handshake period.

* Evaluate vendors on: integration openness, data portability (exportable, schema), SLAs, audit logs, and compliance.

* Budget buckets: tooling (20–40%), people (50–70%), experimentation/creative (10–20%).

---

# **11\) Common pitfalls & red flags (hard truths)**

* **Pitfall: “set it and forget it.”** Automations go stale quickly. You need cadence to review performance.

* **Pitfall: tool fetishism.** The platform doesn’t fix bad data or poor content strategy.

* **Red flag candidate:** can’t explain a past failure or lacks examples of governance.

* **Red flag org:** no clear SLA or ownership between marketing and sales — expect low lead quality and finger-pointing.

* **Pitfall:** overcomplicated scoring/segmentation with no telemetry — you won’t know what’s working.

---

# **12\) Example job posting blurb (short, hire-ready — tune as desired)**

Marketing Automation Manager — You’ll design and own automation systems that turn activity into pipeline and retention. You’re hands-on with a MAP and CRM, write SQL queries for validation, and can run a governance process that makes other teams behave. Expect to deliver a first set of high-impact automations in the first 90 days and build measurement that ties to revenue.

---

# **13\) Interview question bank (copy/paste)**

**Behavioral**

* Tell me about the most complex automation you built. What problem did it solve and how did you measure success?

* Describe a time a campaign failed. What did you do to recover and what did you change afterwards?

**Technical**

* Walk me through how you’d design a lead scoring model for an enterprise SaaS product.

* Given an event stream, how would you detect duplicate identities and dedupe? (expected steps: identify unique keys, deterministic matching, probabilistic matching, human review threshold).

* Write a SQL snippet to find contacts with more than one active subscription ID.

**Practical**

* Here’s a CSV export from our MAP — tell me the three highest priority fixes and why.

---

# **14\) Templates you’ll want immediately (I can produce these)**

* Campaign QA checklist (full ready-to-use spreadsheet).

* Lead scoring calibration workbook (CSV+instructions).

* Runbook template for incident response and rollback.

* Intake form for campaign requests (fields for measurement, audience, content, launch date, approval).

---

# **15\) Final blunt assessment — the hard truths**

* If you think this role is “just email and automations,” you’ll fail. The job is 60% systems and governance, 30% analytics, 10% creative alignment.

* Good automation managers are boring in one way: they make marketing predictable and measurable. That’s less flashy but massively leveraged.

* The single biggest leverage point is **data hygiene**. No pipeline output, no clever nurturing will fix rotten input. Invest there first — everything else scales better.
