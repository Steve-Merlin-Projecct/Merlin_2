## Problem-Solving Under Ambiguity

### Data Questions & Interpretation
**Challenge:** Stakeholders ask broad questions like "What time is best to send newsletters?" or "Are real estate articles worth our time?"

**Approach:**
1. Identify multiple ways to interpret the question
2. Understand organizational values, perspectives, and business logic
3. Consider how team members receive information
4. Frame communication to change behavior toward positive outcomes

**For Open-Ended Questions** (e.g., "How do we make our website better?"):
1. Identify the problem first (resist jumping to solutions)
2. Understand how team members perceive deficiencies
3. Gauge what areas are "acceptable" for problem identification
4. Consider relationship dynamics and past reactions
5. Ask clarifying questions and softly introduce new ideas
6. Assess scope, importance, and timeline
7. Compile learnings from affected team members
8. Gather information from internal/external documents and tools
9. Diagnose and troubleshoot before selecting problem to solve

### Strategic Thinking & Initiative
