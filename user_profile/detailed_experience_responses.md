## FOCUS AREA 1: Problem Solving Under Ambiguity

### Q1: Time when told to "just figure it out" or when no one knew what to do

**Steve's Response:**

Most often this happens when someone asks me for data that will support decision making regarding a specific topic. These may come in the form of specific questions like "What time is the best time of day to send newsletters?" or "Are articles about real estate, homes & interiors, worth our time?"

Even though they are asking a specific question, they may be several ways to interpret the question, gather data, and find out which pieces of data actually matter to the business. This involves the technical skill of solving a problem to get the right data. And it also requires understanding the values, outlook, perspectives, experience of leadership and how those aspects are translated into business logic, how problems are framed, and which ideas win in the organization. It also requires understand how team members best received information and then I have to communicate information in a way that changes behaviour toward positive outcomes.

And often these questions might be very open, like "What can we do do make our website better?" When questions are broad like this, my first step is identify the problem. Although I might have my first reactions that I could use to start solving the problem, but actually the first is to quickly identify how team members perceive the deficiencies and reveal what areas where identifying a problem would be acceptable. I would complete this by considering the relationships I have with team members, and considering how they have reacted to similar problems in the past. This would help by knowing where to start asking clarifying questions to team members. This is the time to softly introduce new ideas and get a feel for the scope of the overall project, how much the results matter, and the timeline. This also provides where they think the problem might be.

After that I would compile what I have learned from my interactions with the team members that would be most effected by the project, I would be begin gathering information using internal and external documents and tools in order to troubleshoot and diagnose the problem. Once I am comfortable in selecting a problem, I would use the process mentioned above for the specific question.

### Q2: Created a system, framework, or repeatable process that didn't exist before

**Example 1: Monthly Client Reporting**

I created a repeatable monthly report for a client. When I was transferred the task from another employee, the process was to manually copy/paste each data cell from table to spreadsheet.

I created a cascading series of sheets that would intake new data, clean, transform, and rearrange the right data into the right cells. It transformed a job that took 2 hours / month down to 15 minutes.

**Example 2: Advertisement Impression Tracking**

Another task that I took over from another employee was tracking the run of site advertisement impressions. Since we have a custom built Wordpress for our website and run the display advertisements in that, Google Ad Manager or some other pre-built system didn't work for us. So instead, in order to track progress daily, I created a spreadsheet system that could intake data and clean and transform and calculate actionable changes.

## FOCUS AREA 2: Strategic Thinking & Initiative

### Q3: Time you looked at data and realized "we're doing this wrong"

**Example: New Publication Initiative**

Some team members wanted to start a new publication, a new digital brand, but my data analysis showed that we could not add more work, if any new initiative was taken, performance dropped elsewhere. There wasn't a good reason for starting a new brand.

However, if they intended to go through with this new initiative, I provided an intrapreneurship strategy that would help find the right product with the right customers. It took 3 years, but I was eventually proven to be correct with my analysis.

## Initial Onboarding Questions

### What was the digital landscape like when you first joined Odvod/Edify in 2020?

**Was the brand struggling online?**

I wouldn't say they were struggling, the website did get a decent amount of traffic. In fact, I found that Chat GPT sourced information from this website as "General Knowledge". However, the rebranding effort in 2020 stalled online growth. I was able to contribute to some positive growth eventually.

**Did they have analytics, campaign tracking, or a consistent strategy?**

They tracked with Google Universal Analytics. It was using default settings.

**What did you do to enhance the marketing of the brand in the digital realm?**

I kept on industry leading edge best practices by following SEO industry leaders on Twitter, reading blog posts, and articles produced by SEM Rush, Search Engine Journal, Ahrefs, Moz, etc., and watched youtube videos. I also read content produced by Google. I watched online conferences, and Q&A sessions between industry and Google Search ambassadors. I also reviewed laws about data privacy for Canada and the US and EU. I read the source documents about accessibility guides and requirements for websites.

I practiced and learnt while doing: I volunteered as a moderator for a local interest-focused Facebook/Instagram page & community unrelated to the Edify brand. I learned the technical aspects of navigating the Meta ecosystem, including how to schedule content, how to make content that gets engagement, how to track and measure engagement, how to manage accounts and user permissions. I also learned about how communications and places affect community, how people feel about topics and how influence shapes how decisions are made and how perspectives broaden, sharpen or change over time.

I participated as users normally do, this helped me understand the memes perspectives, expectations, and standards of online culture. I consumed content on instagram, twitter, facebook, Tik Tok and reddit with a wide range of communities that interest me. From this, I understood how the culture of these spaces, and what makes good and interesting content.

**Implementation for SEO:**

After diving deep into current SEO environment, I consulted with the project manager that was leading the new website (transforming from https://avenueedmonton.com to https://edifyedmonton.com/) as well as the development team to implement new and improved SEO practices into the development of the new website. Through my consulting, we were able to understand the types of actions that could effect the website's SEO, which allowed the team to prioritize which tactics and data structures would be developed in the website. Then I participated in the implementation of those tactics, as well as testing to determine if the development had the expected outputs on the website.

**Why it mattered for SEO:**

The website has continued to rank on Google Search for Edify's niche content of local restaurants, as well as local activities. A majority (70%) of the traffic received by the website is sourced from organic search. Articles produced by EdifyEdmonton.com are presented on the Google Discover page, the most recent being https://edifyedmonton.com/active/things-to-do-active/25-things-to-do-in-edmonton-this-september-2-2/

**Why it mattered for social media:**

I regularly wrote copy for one of our client's social media accounts for about 1 year. When this client came to us with the question of whether they should create a tik tok account (this was when Tik tok was starting to gain popularity), I consulted and provided insight that allowed the client to make an economical decision. I create content (photo or video) for social Edify's social media accounts for the brand's 50,000 followers. I participate in discussions on how to implement content.

### What were you initially hired or tasked to solve or improve?

**Was it audience growth? Better tracking? Transitioning from print to digital? Client strategy?**

I was hired as a "Resource Coordinator," which was basically an administrative assistant. My job has grown to include forward-thinking strategy, content production (photography, image editing, copywriting, copyediting, transforming content from one publication to another), data analysis, IT, mentoring others, interacting with vips, interacting with general public, communicating to vendors, administrative tasks.

**Who did you report to and what expectations were set?**

The expectation is that I would report to the Operations Manager, and support any other team member that needed assistance.

## Action Questions

### What core systems, platforms, or tools did you use?

Yes, I use Google Analytics 4, Mailchimp sourced-data, I created automated reports with Looker Studio. I use Wordpress to publish content online. I use a Customer Management system to convert orders into published media.

### Most complex or high-stakes problems solved

**Problem: Content Category Architecture**

One of the most complex problems I solved was the problem of deciding on the content categories that are publicly available on the website. These are now https://edifyedmonton.com/food/eat-in-take-out-delivery or https://edifyedmonton.com/urban/structures

Deciding on the language of those categories was complex because it had to act as a bridge between the content that was on the old website, and the old brand, and the new brand of the magazine. The categories would shape, form, and funnel future editorial content for the life of the magazine. The categories would define to all audiences what the brand is and what the brand cares about.

Deciding on the categories required analyzing thousands of articles published on the previous website between 2011 - 2020, and having a deep understanding what what was the "heart" of the article, then labeling those articles.

Then with a vision to the future, I provided guidance and suggestions that I brought to the team. Then as a team, we refined those categories and made the website. Those categories are still in use today and are completely unchanged, except for a new initiative that was not yet in effect when the website was created.

To analyze the past articles, I used SEO screaming frog to crawl the website and find every article that existed. Text from the articles was extracted into a spreadsheet that could be searched and analyzed.

**Why it mattered:**

The decision to choose categories matters because the categories become boxes that content must be fit into. It shapes how audiences, including Search Engines, view, understand, and frame the content on the website. This positions the brand.

Additionally, the position of the brand and the need to fit content into given categories shapes how the Editorial team makes decisions about what stories to cover, and how to cover the stories. It's not a rule, but a strong nudge, which is effective. This means that the brand has consistency through time, as the topics of the day change, or staff change, including a new Editor in chief.

### Did you work alone or on a team? Did you lead others?

Most of my work is alone, but I coordinate and rely on others for certain inputs. I will ask other team members to perform certain tasks.

### Biggest strategic insight

**The Rebranding Gap Discovery**

Yes, one of the big insights that I discovered was that the rebranding process took much longer than expected, in the eyes of the public. From what I knew from job experience, as well as what I studied in Entrepreneurship studies in University, under Dr. Timothy Hannigan, is that you have to get face-to-face with customers/audience. I knew this was vital to understand what they audience wanted, in terms of content, which was paramount for our rebranding, and venturing on our own without the coordination of Avenue Calgary.

So I pushed for this to be a cause, and initiative, and it was approved, along with a budget to purchase a custom-designed Edify 10 x10 popup tent that would be match the size and style of vendors at Farmers' markets. But no other team member would participate in the public events, not even the principal of the business, nor the senior editor. They did not want to face the public. So it was up to me to do the job by myself.

In the following summer season, I attended over 70 farmers' markets across the city. And at each, I used the sales and customer service, and merchandising skills that I developed at my previous employment, to engineer engagement with market patrons. I had multiple goals: to promote the Edify brand, to discover what types of media they prefer (long stories, short stories, photo essays, recipes, games-puzzles, listicles etc.) and what topics (food, entertainment & arts, people, innovation etc.), and introduce business owners to our advertising sales pipeline.

**The Unexpected Insight:**

The unexpected insight that I gathered, however, was that most people didn't understand that the magazine had rebranded the previous year. The audience assumed that Avenue Edmonton ceased to be, and that we were an upstart magazine. I discovered this over thousands of conversations.

**What I did with this information:**

I brought this information back to the team - that we would have to continue to provide language in our outbound messaging and editorial content, that the magazine used to be Avenue Edmonton, but is now under the name Edify magazine.

Additionally, I changed my opening pitch for engaging with market patrons to include the information that we used to be Avenue Edmonton. So even if someone wasn't in the mood to carry a copy of the magazine, or engage with my booth, just by walking past they would learn that the magazine had rebranded.

Then I would measure, and over the next year or two, the percentage of people that would reply "I know you used to be Avenue magazine" increased to at least ¾ people that seemed like they would be part (by my demographic/social profiling) of our audience. I assessed that this was an acceptable level. The tide had turned enough that it was common knowledge and that friends and acquaintances could educated each other - I could head back to the office and would no longer have to sacrifice my evenings and weekends to make secure rebranding success.

### Why would a future employer in a higher-paying role care about this experience?

**Social Skills & Professional Maturity**

One area that I have a major amount of skill development, even starting at an advanced position, in is social skills. As a journalistic endeavour, the business must deal with public perception of the masses. The problem with the masses is that they might not be fully informed or invested in a brand: like a social media influencer, or local independent restaurant, or niche industrial business.

The consequence is that public perception trends can be volatile, when it comes to certain social hot topics in meta/local/provincial/federal politics. Sure, there's of course things that are the current event topics of the day to be aware of, but beyond that, we have to be super cautious about every image - it requires different thinking than when the audience is invested or friendly to the publisher. We have to think, for example "could .05% of our audience hallucinate-perceive a penis in this photo?" If so, it has to be changed.

We also must have good social relationships with the high profile people that are featured in the magazine - having their cooperation is what makes the magazine desirable to audiences - it's because we have access to busy, successful people. Besides the mayor and politicians, we feature business leaders, local subject experts, and the occasional celebrity with an interview and photoshoot. Just last fall, we featured actor Lisa Gilroy, complete with a photoshoot performed here in Edmonton.

These people give their time and their energy to the magazine. Sure, they often get publicity out of it, but they don't have to do it. And some of them, like Lisa Gilroy, probably don't need publicity here in Edmonton. Occasionally, I interact with these people while representing Edify. These interactions are at our events (Top 40 Under 40, Best Restaurants Event, Innovation in Edmonton), or while I am performing promotional work with the Edify event tent (Farmers' Markets, Elks Game Tailgate party, Outdoor concerts: Together Again).

Leadership of Odvod trusts me to represent the brand in those moments with high profile people. I am trusted to handle potentially awkward situations when a high profile person may request media coverage or information. This matters because we are often privy to sensitive and confidential information about the people and their networks in the community.

**Handling Disagreement with Maturity**

Another way that I develop social skills and corporate business environment acumen, is that I have learned how to act when I don't get my way. For example, if I've been asked to analyze and suggest a course of action on a certain topic, and as the only person tasked with this assignment, I assumed that my cheap, correct, fully-researched, significant positive return suggestion would be accepted by leadership, but that was not the case. It's just the didn't want to do it - it may take them 2 or 3 years to discover that I was correct, but for me, that was ok because I handled it with maturity. I didn't make a big stink about it, or retreat. I was able to move on to my next task.
