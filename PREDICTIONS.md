### CAREER OVERVIEW (Will Need Manual Splitting)

| Template Variable | Expected Source | Prediction |

| `<<skill_4>>` | ? | ⚠️ COMPLEX |
| `<<skill_5>>` | ? | ⚠️ COMPLEX |

## KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Data Structure Mismatch
- Steve's data is hierarchical and categorized
- Template expects flat, numbered variables

### 2. Missing Template Variables
The template is MISSING these critical variables:
- `company_1` (exists in data, not in template!)
- `start_date_1` (exists in data, not in template!)
- `degree_1`, `graduation_date_1` (education details)

### 3. Format Differences
- **Career Overview**: 1 paragraph vs 5 statements needed
- **Skills**: Categorized groups vs 6 individual items
- **Interests**: Comma-separated string vs 6 variables
- **Location**: "Edmonton, AB" vs separate city/state

### 4. Steve Glen is Marketing, Template is Restaurant
- Steve is a Marketing/Digital Strategist
- Template designed for Restaurant Manager
- Content mismatch is intentional for testing
