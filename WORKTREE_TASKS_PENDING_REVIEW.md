```bash
# Check synopsis files
ls -la /workspace/.trees/.completed/*synopsis*.md

# Check what was merged from a specific branch
git log --oneline develop/v4.3.3-worktrees-20251017-044814 --grep="<task-keyword>"

# View branch commit history
git log --oneline <branch-name>

# Check file changes in merged commits
git diff develop/v4.3.3-worktrees-20251017-044814~10..develop/v4.3.3-worktrees-20251017-044814 --name-only
