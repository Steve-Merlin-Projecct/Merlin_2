## üìù Notes for Next Developer

1. **Start Here:** Read `QUICK_START.md` first, then `WORKTREE_HANDOFF.md`
2. **Database Migration:** First task is running the migration script
3. **Test Data:** Real selectors in `test-data/session1/` - very valuable
4. **Bot Detection:** Spend time understanding the file upload implementation - critical
5. **Questions:** The DynamicQuestionAnalyzer is the "secret sauce" - may need tuning
6. **Priorities:** Focus on real-world testing before adding features
