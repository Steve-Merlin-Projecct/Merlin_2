**Natural Language Algorithm for Resume and Cover Letter Content Optimization**

# Agent:
You are university proffesor that specializes in mathematics, statistics, and complex computer algorithms. You are invested the success of my project.

# Prompt:
 First, I want to discuss the why's behind different approaches to solving the following problem. We will leave implementation for later.

Task: We are creating an algorithm. The algorithm selects text content, given scored inputs and limitations.

**Phase 1**

We will develop the algorithm in phases, increasing in complexity. We can change models, methods and inputs from phase to phase.

Situation: I creating an automated resume and cover letter generation system. I have structured output of the job description with the required skills and the relevant importance of that skill for this job. I also have a list of keywords and key phrases from the job description.

In another table, I have a list of approved setences that will be inserted into my cover letter and resume. Each sentence has been categorized depending on its intended destination. For example, setences that are suitable for the resume/general field in the resume are marked in the respective columns in the data base as "resume" and "general." A sentence for resume/work experience 1 is labelled as "resume" and "workexp_id_4764646". And sentences for coverletter/opening sentence are categorized as document:"cover" position:"opening" in the table. 

These setences are also categorized for the skill that they demonstrate. There will be ~30 approved sentences of each skill and intended destination type, with variation in word choice setence structure and length. A python script will analyze the sentences for keywords and key phrases from the job description and output a matching score.

I have limited placements of setences in my resume and cover letter based on the template.

I want to insert content that matches job description.

Goal: To increase the relevance of my resume and cover letter to the job description within the given limitations, while appearing to be organically constructed and reviewed by a skill and fluet human (language professional, copywriter).

Problem: I'm not sure where to start. For example, do I rank each section (resume/general, resume/work-experience1, resume/work experience2, resume/education1, resume/education2, coverletter/) individually, or do I rank the application as a total package?

When do I allow multiple instances of a skill within the same section? Do I install a limit of a specific skill demonstration across any single section or across the entire document? And how do I balance the skill importance with my skill+keyword rating to determine if a skill should be showcased multiple times? or if at all?

# Response:
This is a fascinating and complex problem! You're essentially building a content optimization engine for resumes and cover letters, and the approach you take will significantly impact the quality and effectiveness of the generated documents. Let's break down the "why" behind different approaches and consider the trade-offs.

**Ranking Scope: Individual Sections vs. Total Package**

* **Individual Section Ranking:**
   * **Why:**  This approach ensures each section is optimized independently, focusing on the specific skills and keywords most relevant to that section's purpose. For example, "work experience" sections might prioritize different skills than the "education" section.
   * **Benefit:**  Allows for fine-grained control and ensures each section is strong on its own merits.
   * **Drawback:**  Might lead to repetition of skills across sections, potentially making the overall document feel less cohesive.
 * **Total Package Ranking:**
   * **Why:**  This approach considers the entire resume and cover letter as a unified document, aiming for a balanced representation of skills across all sections.
   * **Benefit:**  Promotes a more holistic view, preventing oversaturation of certain skills and ensuring a diverse range of qualifications are showcased.
   * **Drawback:**  Might result in weaker individual sections if a skill crucial to a specific section is downplayed to maintain overall balance.

**Recommendation:** **Start with individual section ranking.** It provides a solid foundation and allows you to later implement mechanisms to address potential repetition. Once you have a working system, you can experiment with incorporating a "total package" score as a secondary factor to refine the selection.
 * **Implementation Tip:** You could calculate a "section-specific" score for each sentence based on its skill match, keyword match, and relevance to the section's purpose. Then, within each section, rank sentences based on this score.

**Skill Repetition: Balancing Act**

* **Allowing Multiple Instances:**
   * **Why:**  Some skills are core to the job and deserve multiple demonstrations.
   * **Benefit:**  Reinforces your suitability for the role.
   * **Drawback:**  Can make the document feel repetitive and less nuanced.
* **Limiting Repetition:**
   * **Why:**  Promotes diversity and showcases a broader range of abilities.
   * **Benefit:**  Makes the document more engaging and avoids redundancy.
   * **Drawback:**  Might underrepresent crucial skills.

**Recommendation:** **Implement a tiered approach to skill repetition.**

1. **Section-Level Limits:** Set a maximum number of times a skill can appear within a single section. This prevents oversaturation within a specific area.
2. **Document-Level Limits:** Set a global limit for highly important skills to ensure they are highlighted without dominating the entire document.
3. **Importance-Based Thresholds:**  Use the job description's skill importance scores to adjust repetition thresholds. More important skills can be allowed to appear more frequently.

* **Implementation Tip:**

   * Create a data structure via postgresql to track skill occurrences within each section and the document as a whole.
   * During sentence selection, check if adding a sentence would exceed the skill's repetition limit for the section or document.
   * Consider using a "decay factor" for skill importance: allow more repetitions for highly important skills, but gradually decrease the threshold as importance decreases.

**Balancing Skill Importance and Keyword Match**

* **Challenge:** A sentence might have a high keyword match but demonstrate a less important skill, or vice versa.

**Recommendation:** **Use a weighted scoring system.**

* **Assign weights:** Give higher weights to skill importance from the job description and lower weights to keyword matches. Experiment with different weightings to find the optimal balance.
 * **Combine Scores:** Calculate a composite score for each sentence by multiplying the skill importance score, keyword match score, and potentially other factors (sentence length, diversity, etc.).

* **Implementation Tip:**

   * Normalize your skill importance and keyword match scores to a common scale (e.g., 0-1) before combining them.
   * Consider using machine learning techniques like regression to learn optimal weightings based on examples of successful resumes and cover letters.


**Phase 1 Focus:**

For Phase 1, prioritize:

1. **Individual Section Ranking:** Implement a scoring system for sentences within each section based on skill match, keyword match, and section relevance.
2. **Basic Skill Repetition Limits:** Set initial section-level limits for skill occurrences.
3. **Weighted Scoring:** Combine skill importance and keyword match scores with adjustable weights.

Remember, this is an iterative process. Start with a simpler approach, gather feedback, and gradually refine your algorithm based on the quality of the generated resumes and cover letters. Good luck with your project!

### **1. Ranking Scope: Individual Sections vs. Total Package**

**Approach:**  
Prioritize **individual section ranking** to ensure each section is optimized independently. Later, introduce a mechanism to refine the selection based on the total package.

**Steps:**  
1. **Section-Specific Scoring:**  
   - For each sentence, calculate a **section-specific score** based on:  
     - **Skill Match Score:** How well the sentence aligns with skills required for the section.  
     - **Keyword Match Score:** Presence and frequency of job description keywords.  
     - **Section Relevance:** Categorical match (e.g., "resume/workexp" for work experience sections).  
   - Formula:  
     \[
     \text{Section Score} = (\text{Skill Match Score} \times w_1) + (\text{Keyword Match Score} \times w_2) + (\text{Section Relevance} \times w_3)
     \]  
     Where \( w_1, w_2, w_3 \) are weights (e.g., \( w_1 = 0.5 \), \( w_2 = 0.3 \), \( w_3 = 0.2 \)).  

2. **Ranking Within Sections:**  
   - Rank sentences within each section based on the **Section Score**.  

3. **Total Package Refinement (Phase 2):**  
   - Introduce a **Document Score** that considers skill diversity across all sections.  
   - Adjust rankings to ensure no single skill dominates the entire document.  

**Considerations:**  
- Start with section-specific ranking to establish a strong foundation.  
- Use the total package score as a secondary refinement step.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Normalize scores to a common scale (e.g., 0-1) for consistency.  


---

### **2. Skill Repetition: Balancing Act**

**Approach:**  
Implement a **tiered repetition limit system** to balance skill demonstrations.  

**Steps:**  
1. **Section-Level Limits:**  
   - Set a maximum number of occurrences for each skill within a section (e.g., 2 mentions per skill per section).  

2. **Document-Level Limits:**  
   - Set a global limit for highly important skills (e.g., maximum 4 mentions across the entire document).  

3. **Importance-Based Thresholds:**  
   - Adjust repetition limits based on skill importance from the job description:  
     - High importance: Higher repetition allowance.  
     - Low importance: Lower repetition allowance.  

**Considerations:**  
- Avoid oversaturation of skills in any single section.  
- Ensure critical skills are highlighted without dominating the document.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Use a counter dictionary to track skill occurrences (e.g., `skill_counts["Python"]["resume/workexp"] = 2`).  
- Apply limits during sentence selection: skip sentences that exceed thresholds.  

---

### **3. Balancing Skill Importance and Keyword Match**

**Approach:**  
Use a **weighted scoring system** to combine skill importance and keyword matches.  

**Steps:**  
1. **Normalize Scores:**  
   - Normalize skill importance and keyword match scores to a common scale (e.g., 0-1).  

2. **Weighted Combination:**  
   - Calculate a **Composite Score** for each sentence:  
     \[
     \text{Composite Score} = (\text{Normalized Skill Importance} \times w_1) + (\text{Normalized Keyword Match} \times w_2)
     \]  
     Where \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) are weights (e.g., \( w_1 = 0.7 \), \( w_2 = 0.3 \)).  

3. **Adjust Weights:**  
   - Experiment with weights to prioritize skill importance or keyword matches based on feedback.  

**Considerations:**  
- Skill importance should generally carry more weight, as it reflects the job’s core requirements.  
- Keyword matches add relevance but should not overshadow skill demonstrations.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Precompute normalized scores for efficiency.  
- Use a configuration file to store and adjust weights.

### **Algorithm Workflow**

1. **Input:**  
   - Job description with skill importance scores.  
   - Approved sentences categorized by section and skill.  
   - Keyword and key phrase matches for each sentence.  

2. **Processing:**  
   - For each section:  
     - Calculate **Section Scores** for all sentences.  
     - Rank sentences within the section.  
     - Apply **section-level skill repetition limits**.  
   - Select top-ranked sentences for each section.  

3. **Refinement (Optional):**  
   - Calculate **Document Scores** to ensure skill diversity.  
   - Apply **document-level skill repetition limits**.  

4. **Output:**  
   - Optimized sentences for each section, balanced for skill importance, keyword matches, and repetition.  

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
# Inputs
job_description = {skill: importance_score, ...}
sentences = [{text, section, skill, keyword_match_score, ...}, ...]
weights = {"skill_importance": 0.7, "keyword_match": 0.3}

# Initialize skill counters
skill_counts = {"section": {skill: 0, ...}, ...}

# Process each section
for section in sections:
    # Calculate Section Scores
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence["section"] == section:
            normalized_skill_importance = job_description[sentence["skill"]] / max(job_description.values())
            normalized_keyword_match = sentence["keyword_match_score"] / max_keyword_score
            composite_score = (normalized_skill_importance * weights["skill_importance"]) + (normalized_keyword_match * weights["keyword_match"])
            sentence["section_score"] = composite_score

    # Rank sentences
    ranked_sentences = sorted(sentences, key=lambda x: x["section_score"], reverse=True)

    # Apply section-level repetition limits
    selected_sentences = []
    for sentence in ranked_sentences:
        if skill_counts[section][sentence["skill"]] < section_limit:
            selected_sentences.append(sentence)
            skill_counts[section][sentence["skill"]] += 1
        if len(selected_sentences) >= section_capacity:
            break

    # Assign to section
    resume[section] = selected_sentences

# Optional: Apply document-level limits (Phase 2)
```

This algorithm ensures a structured, balanced approach to content selection while addressing the key challenges of ranking scope, skill repetition, and score balancing.
