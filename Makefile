# Job Application Automation System - Project Commands
# 
# This Makefile serves as the central command interface for the entire project.
# It provides convenient shortcuts for common development, testing, and database tasks.
#
# LOCATION RATIONALE:
# - Located in project root following industry standard conventions
# - Provides easy access from anywhere in the project (make commands work from root)
# - Serves as project-wide command interface, not just database-specific
# - Developers expect 'make help' to work from project root
#
# USAGE:
# - Run 'make help' to see all available commands
# - All commands are designed to be run from the project root directory
# - Database commands handle schema automation and documentation
# - Testing commands validate system functionality and dependency loading
# - Development commands provide convenient server startup options
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
# - Database tools are in database_tools/ but controlled from root Makefile
# - Testing infrastructure spans multiple directories (tests/, modules/)
# - Development commands use both direct Python and Gunicorn approaches
# - All paths are relative to project root for consistency

# Database Schema Automation Commands
# These commands manage PostgreSQL schema documentation and code generation
# All database tools are located in database_tools/ but controlled from root

# Testing Commands
# Comprehensive testing infrastructure for system validation

	@echo "   - Validates smart dependency loading system"
	@echo "   - Tests numpy, bleach, docx, genai, trafilatura loading"
	@echo "   - Verifies mock interfaces and fallback mechanisms"
	python tests/test_dependency_optimization.py

# Development Commands
# Server startup options for development and testing
start:
	@echo "üöÄ Starting application..."
	@echo "   - Uses direct Python execution via main.py"
	@echo "   - Suitable for development and debugging"
	python main.py

dev:
	@echo "üîß Starting development server with auto-reload..."
	@echo "   - Uses Gunicorn with auto-reload enabled"
	@echo "   - Automatically restarts on file changes"
	@echo "   - Binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 for external access"
	gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --reload main:app
