# ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Worktree**: create-securitydetections-table-in-production-data
**Status**: Merged to main, pending production deployment

---

## What's Missing in Production

Two database tables were added in development but not yet deployed to production:

1. **`security_detections`** - Logs LLM injection attempts and security events
2. **`job_analysis_tiers`** - Tracks 3-tier sequential batch analysis workflow

---

## Impact

Without these tables, the following features **will fail in production**:

- ‚ùå Tiered job analysis API endpoints (`/api/analyze/tier1`, `/tier2`, `/tier3`)
- ‚ùå Security detection logging for prompt injections
- ‚ùå Sequential batch scheduler
- ‚ùå Unpunctuated text stream detector

**Error you'll see**: `relation "security_detections" does not exist`

---

## Deploy Now (1 minute)

```bash
# Step 1: Check what needs deployment
python database_tools/verify_production_migrations.py

# Step 2: Deploy to production (if you have access)
python database_tools/verify_production_migrations.py --apply-to-production

# Step 3: Verify success
python database_tools/verify_production_migrations.py
# Should show: "‚úì READY TO MERGE - Production is up to date"
```

## Don't Have Production Access?

See: **`tasks/PENDING-production-migration-deployment.md`**

Options:
1. Whitelist your IP on Digital Ocean database firewall
2. Deploy from a whitelisted machine
3. Use Digital Ocean console to run SQL

---

## Migration Files

Located in `database_tools/migrations/`:
- `001_create_security_detections_table.sql`
- `002_create_job_analysis_tiers_table.sql`

---

## Once Deployed

1. ‚úÖ Run verification script to confirm
2. ‚úÖ Delete this file: `rm PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-NEEDED.md`
3. ‚úÖ Mark task complete: `tasks/PENDING-production-migration-deployment.md`
4. ‚úÖ Monitor production logs for any database errors
