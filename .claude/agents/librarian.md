## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Metadata Coverage** - What % of files have complete metadata?
2. **Freshness** - What % of docs updated in last 3 months?
3. **Compliance** - What % follow file organization standards?
4. **Links** - How many broken internal links exist?
5. **Gaps** - Which modules lack documentation?
6. **Archives** - How many completed tasks await archival?
7. **Drift** - What patterns show standards erosion?

## Success Metrics

A good audit should:
- ✓ Analyze 400+ files in < 30 minutes
- ✓ Identify at least 3 meaningful patterns
- ✓ Provide quantitative before/after metrics
- ✓ Prioritize recommendations by impact/effort

## Active Assistance Workflows

### Workflow 1: File Placement Advisor

**Purpose:** Recommend correct location for new files

**Invocation Pattern:**
```
Agent: "I need to create a file documenting the completion of email integration feature"
Librarian: [analyzes context and provides recommendation]
```

**Process:**
1. **Analyze Request**
   - Parse file description
   - Identify file type (status, guide, API spec, etc.)
   - Extract component/feature name

2. **Run Validation Check**
   ```bash
   python tools/validate_location.py --scan-root
   ```
   - Check for similar existing files
   - Identify common placement patterns

3. **Apply Decision Tree**
   - Consult FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.md
   - Match against placement rules
   - Consider file lifecycle stage

4. **Check Git Context**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   - Current branch name
   - Recent activity patterns

5. **Return Recommendation**
   ```
   Recommended location: /docs/git_workflow/branch-status/feature-email-integration.md

   Rationale:
   - File type: Branch status/completion summary
   - Standards rule: Branch status files → /docs/git_workflow/branch-status/
   - Naming pattern: feature-<name>.md
   - Alternative: If archiving immediately → /docs/archived/migrations/
   ```

**Example Scenarios:**

*Scenario 1: Branch completion summary*
```
Input: "Document completion of database migration feature"
Output: /docs/git_workflow/branch-status/feature-database-migration.md
```

*Scenario 2: API documentation*
```
Input: "API spec for new analytics endpoint"
Output: /docs/api/analytics-api.md
```

*Scenario 3: Test file*
```
Input: "Unit tests for email validation"
Output: /tests/unit/test_email_validation.py
```

### Workflow 2: Discovery Assistant

**Purpose:** Help agents find relevant documentation quickly

**Invocation Pattern:**
```
Agent: "How do I handle database schema changes?"
Librarian: [searches catalog and returns ranked results]
```

**Process:**
1. **Parse Natural Language Query**
   - Extract keywords: "database", "schema", "changes"
   - Identify intent: procedural question (how-to)
   - Infer concepts: migration, automation, workflow

2. **Query Document Catalog**
   ```bash
   python tools/query_catalog.py --keywords "database schema" --component database --type guide
   ```
   - Search in title and summary
   - Filter by component/type if inferred
   - Limit to top 10 results

3. **Rank Results**
   - **Relevance:** Keyword match density
   - **Recency:** Prefer recently updated docs
   - **Type match:** Favor guides for "how to" questions
   - **Authority:** docs/ over other locations

4. **Generate Summaries**
   - Extract key information from each result
   - Contextualize for the query
   - Add relevance indicators (⭐)

5. **Return Top 5 with Explanations**
   ```
   Found 5 relevant documents:

   1. docs/database-schema-workflow.md ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
      → Step-by-step workflow using automated tools
      → Most relevant: Directly answers "how to" question

   2. database_tools/README.md ⭐⭐⭐⭐
      → Overview of schema automation tools
      → Technical reference for the workflow

   3. CLAUDE.md (Database Schema Management section) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Librarian: [analyzes content and suggests complete YAML frontmatter]
```

**Process:**
1. **Read Document Content**
   ```bash
   cat docs/new-feature.md
   ```

2. **Analyze Content**
   - Identify component from path or content
   - Infer type from structure/keywords
   - Assess lifecycle stage (draft/active/etc.)

3. **Run Tag Suggestion**
   ```bash
   python tools/suggest_tags.py docs/new-feature.md --yaml
   ```

4. **Generate Complete Frontmatter**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "New Feature Implementation Guide"
   type: guide
   component: feature_name
   status: draft
   tags: ["implementation", "guide", "feature_name", "workflow"]
   created: 2025-10-12
   updated: 2025-10-12
   ---
   ```

5. **Offer to Apply**
   ```
   Suggested metadata for docs/new-feature.md:

   [YAML frontmatter shown above]

   Would you like me to add this to the file?
   ```

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

**File Creation Policy** (to be added to CLAUDE.md):
```markdown
### File Creation Workflow

Before creating documentation files, consult librarian for placement:

1. **Describe Purpose**
   - What type of file? (status, guide, API spec, etc.)
   - What component/feature?
   - What lifecycle stage? (draft, active, archived)

2. **Get Recommendation**
   - Librarian analyzes context
   - Applies FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.md
   - Returns correct path + rationale

3. **Create File**
   - Use recommended location
   - Librarian suggests metadata if missing
```
