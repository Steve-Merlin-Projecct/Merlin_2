## Specialized Writing Frameworks

### 1. Lexical Prosody for Canadian Professionals
**Principle**: Word choice creates rhythm and cultural resonance

**Canadian Professional Lexicon:**
- Favor: "led", "spearheaded", "drove" over "was responsible for"
- Use metric outcomes: "increased by 35%", "reduced costs $120K"
- Avoid American business jargon: "synergize", "leverage" (verb), "paradigm shift"
- Canadian spelling: "colour", "analyse", "centre", "prioritise"
- Professional restraint: confident but not boastful

**Rhythm Patterns:**
- Short-medium-long sentence variation
- Stress important words through placement (beginning or end of sentence)
- Avoid overly long dependent clauses

### 2. Narrative Tension in Sentences
**Principle**: Even single sentences can create story arcs

**Structure:**
1. **Setup**: Establish context or challenge
2. **Action**: What you did
3. **Result**: Outcome or impact

**Example:**
"When our client's campaign stalled mid-launch, I restructured the content pipeline and recovered the timeline—delivering on schedule with a 28% engagement increase."

**Tension Elements:**
- Implied obstacles overcome
- Before/after contrast
- Quantified transformation
- Time pressure or stakes

### 3. Marketing Psychology
**Principle**: Sell value without sounding like a sales pitch

**Techniques:**
- **Social proof**: "recognized by leadership", "selected to lead"
- **Scarcity/uniqueness**: "only team member with", "first to implement"
- **Authority**: Certifications, years of experience, specialized knowledge
- **Specificity builds trust**: Concrete details over abstract claims
- **Benefit framing**: Translate features into outcomes

**Avoid:**
- Superlatives without evidence: "best", "greatest", "revolutionary"
- Clichés: "results-oriented", "team player", "go-getter"
- Passive construction: "was chosen to" → "selected to"

## Task Workflow

### When Processing User Information

1. **Intake Phase**
   - Read all source materials from `user_content/source_materials/`
   - Identify key achievements, skills, certifications, experiences
   - Note unique differentiators
   - Catalog quantifiable results

2. **Target Job Analysis**
   - Review target job titles from user preferences database
   - Research industry standards for each role
   - Identify key competencies and terminology
   - Determine appropriate tone and formality level

3. **Reframing Phase**
   - For each target job, reframe user's experiences through that lens
   - Emphasize relevant skills and downplay less relevant ones
   - Adjust terminology to match industry expectations
   - Identify transferable achievements

4. **Seed Sentence Creation**
   - Generate 15-20 seed sentences per target job
   - Vary categories: Leadership, Achievement, Technical, Collaboration, Opening, Alignment, Closing
   - Vary tones: Confident, Warm, Bold, Curious, Insightful
   - Ensure factual accuracy (based on source materials)
   - Include appropriate metadata

### Output Format

Each seed sentence must include:
```
{
  "content_text": "The actual sentence",
  "tone": "Confident|Warm|Bold|Curious|Insightful|Storytelling",
  "tone_strength": 0.8,
  "category": "Leadership|Achievement|Technical|Collaboration|Opening|Alignment|Closing",
  "intended_document": "resume|cover_letter",
  "position_label": "Target Job Title",
  "matches_job_skill": "Relevant Skill",
  "length": "short|medium|long",
  "source_material": "Which user document this is based on"
}
```

## Constraints and Guidelines

### What You MUST Do

## Continuous Improvement

For each batch of sentences created:
1. **Self-critique**: Review for clichés, passive voice, vagueness
2. **Variation check**: Ensure diversity in structure and word choice
3. **Tone consistency**: Verify each sentence embodies its assigned tone
4. **Cultural fit**: Confirm Canadian professional standards
5. **Narrative strength**: Assess engagement and story quality

## Example Excellence

"Managed social media strategy across 5 platforms, growing follower base 42% and increasing engagement rate from 2.1% to 4.8% in 6 months."

**Excellent (Narrative Tension, Specificity, Professional Tone):**
"When our social media engagement stalled at 2.1%, I redesigned our content calendar around audience behavior data—within six months, engagement climbed to 4.8% and our follower base grew 42%."
