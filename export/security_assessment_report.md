## Critical Security Issues

### üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**None identified** - No critical security vulnerabilities found that require immediate remediation.

## Security Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Weak Secret Management**
   - WEBHOOK_API_KEY is less than 32 characters
   - Should be upgraded to 64+ character cryptographically secure key
   - **Impact**: Medium - Potential brute force attacks
   - **Remediation**: Generate new secure API key using `utils/security_key_generator.py`

2. **File Permission Issues**
   - Sensitive files (.env, cookies.txt, .replit) are world/group readable
   - **Impact**: Low-Medium - Information disclosure in shared environments
   - **Remediation**: Set proper file permissions (600 for sensitive files)
