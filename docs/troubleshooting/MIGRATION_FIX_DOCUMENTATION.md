# Database Migration Fix Documentation

## Phase 1: Fix Blocked Migrations - COMPLETED ✓

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Successfully Fixed and Verified
**Performance Improvement:** 98% faster queries

## Summary

Fixed critical database migration issues that were blocking dashboard performance improvements. The migrations were failing due to references to non-existent columns in the jobs table.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Column Name Mismatches
- **`jobs.priority_score`** → Mapped to `prestige_factor` (or 0 if NULL)
- **`jobs.salary_currency`** → Mapped from `compensation_currency`
- **`jobs.location`** → Synthesized from `office_city`, `office_province`, `office_country`
- **`jobs.experience_level`** → Mapped from `seniority_level`

### 2. Materialized View Issues
- Dropped and recreated `application_summary_mv` with correct column mappings
- Added UNIQUE index for CONCURRENTLY refresh capability
- Created performance indexes on key columns

### 3. Performance Indexes Added
- `idx_jobs_created_at` - For temporal queries
- `idx_job_apps_created_at` - For recent applications
- `idx_job_apps_job_id` - For JOIN operations
- `idx_jobs_company_id` - For company lookups
- `idx_job_apps_status` - For status filtering

## Performance Results

### Query Performance Improvements
- **Recent Applications Query:** 98.1% faster (39.32ms → 0.76ms)
- **Company Statistics:** Sub-millisecond response (0.71ms)
- **Status Distribution:** Sub-millisecond response (0.34ms)
- **Overall Dashboard Load:** From 250ms to under 50ms

### Test Results
✓ Materialized view operational with 9 records
✓ All column mappings verified
✓ 15 performance indexes installed
✓ Aggregation tables created
✓ Refresh function working
✓ Data integrity verified

## Database Changes That Affect Other Systems

### 1. New Materialized View: `application_summary_mv`

**Purpose:** Pre-computed JOIN of job_applications, jobs, and companies tables

**Usage:**
```sql
-- OLD (Don't use)
SELECT ja.*, j.job_title, c.name
FROM job_applications ja
LEFT JOIN jobs j ON ja.job_id = j.id
LEFT JOIN companies c ON j.company_id = c.id;

-- NEW (Use this)
SELECT * FROM application_summary_mv;
```

**Columns Available:**
- All job_application fields (prefixed as `application_*`)
- All job fields (including mapped columns)
- All company fields (prefixed as `company_*`)

**Column Mappings:**
- `salary_currency` → sourced from `compensation_currency`
- `location` → concatenated from office fields
- `experience_level` → sourced from `seniority_level`
- `priority_score` → sourced from `prestige_factor` (0 if NULL)

### 2. Refresh Requirements

The materialized view must be refreshed periodically to stay current:

**Manual Refresh:**
```sql
SELECT refresh_application_summary();
```

**Automatic Refresh Options:**

Option 1 - Cron Job (Recommended):
```bash
# Add to crontab (every 5 minutes)
*/5 * * * * psql -h localhost -U postgres -d local_Merlin_3 -c "SELECT refresh_application_summary();"
```

Option 2 - API Endpoint:
```python
@app.route('/api/admin/refresh-materialized-views', methods=['POST'])
def refresh_views():
    cursor.execute("SELECT refresh_application_summary()")
    return jsonify({"status": "refreshed"})
```

Option 3 - Application Triggers:
```python
# After any job_application insert/update
def after_application_change():
    # Queue refresh or run immediately
    refresh_materialized_view()
```

### 3. Aggregation Tables

Two new tables for pre-computed metrics:

**`dashboard_metrics_daily`** - Daily aggregated metrics
**`dashboard_metrics_hourly`** - Hourly aggregated metrics

**Usage:**
```sql
-- Get last 7 days metrics
SELECT * FROM dashboard_metrics_daily
WHERE metric_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### 4. Code Changes Required

**Dashboard Routes (`modules/dashboard/routes.py`):**
```python
# BEFORE
def get_recent_applications():
    query = """
        SELECT ja.*, j.job_title, c.name
        FROM job_applications ja
        LEFT JOIN jobs j ON ja.job_id = j.id
        LEFT JOIN companies c ON j.company_id = c.id
        ORDER BY ja.created_at DESC
        LIMIT 20
    """

# AFTER
def get_recent_applications():
    query = """
        SELECT * FROM application_summary_mv
        ORDER BY created_at DESC
        LIMIT 20
    """
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files
1. `/fix_migrations.py` - Main migration fix script
2. `/check_schema.py` - Schema verification utility
3. `/test_dashboard_performance.py` - Performance testing script
4. `/verify_migrations.py` - Comprehensive verification script
5. `/database_migrations/002_dashboard_materialized_views_FIXED.sql` - Fixed migration

### Modified Database Objects
1. Dropped and recreated `application_summary_mv` materialized view
2. Created 5 new performance indexes
3. Created `refresh_application_summary()` function
4. Verified `dashboard_metrics_daily` and `dashboard_metrics_hourly` tables

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, rollback with:
```sql
-- Drop materialized view
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS application_summary_mv CASCADE;

-- Drop refresh function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS refresh_application_summary();

-- Drop triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_invalidate_app_summary_applications ON job_applications;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_invalidate_app_summary_jobs ON jobs;

-- Note: Keep indexes and aggregation tables as they don't harm existing functionality
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Set up automatic refresh** (5-minute interval recommended)
2. **Update application code** to use materialized view
3. **Monitor performance** for first 24 hours

### Optional Enhancements
1. Backfill aggregation tables with historical data
2. Add monitoring for refresh times
3. Create admin panel for manual refresh
4. Set up alerts for stale data

## Impact on Other Phases

This fix unblocks all subsequent dashboard enhancement phases:
- Phase 2: Dashboard Views can now load in <50ms
- Phase 3: Search & Filters will use indexed columns
- Phase 4: Export will benefit from pre-aggregated data
- Phase 5: PWA can cache materialized view data
- Phase 7: Testing has baseline performance metrics

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Materialized view refresh time stays under 1 second
- [ ] Dashboard queries remain under 50ms
- [ ] No data staleness issues reported
- [ ] Indexes are being used (check pg_stat_user_indexes)
- [ ] No blocking during refresh operations

## Support Information

**Issue:** Dashboard slow or showing stale data
**Solution:** Run `SELECT refresh_application_summary();`

**Issue:** Queries still slow after migration
**Solution:** Verify using materialized view, not direct JOINs

**Issue:** Column not found errors
**Solution:** Use mapped column names (see mappings above)
