## Project Vision

An intelligent, automated job application system that scrapes job postings, analyzes requirements using AI, generates personalized resumes and cover letters from approved content libraries, and manages the entire application workflow including email outreach, interview scheduling, and performance tracking.

## System Architecture Overview

### Phase 3: 
**Current Status**: Full system build, end to end, but simple

### Phase 4:
- **Advanced Features**: Multi-platform bot automation, anti-detection measures
- 
## Core Components

### 1. Job Discovery & Collection Engine

- **Data**: Raw, platform-specific fields, hash signatures for exact duplicate detection
- **Sources**: Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, WeWorkRemotely, industry-specific boards

#### Tier 2: Platform-Specific Jobs (`jobs_per_platform`)
- **Purpose**: Deduplicated jobs within each platform
- **Data**: Cleaned and structured job data, similarity hashes for cross-platform matching
- **Features**: Platform-specific formatting and field extraction

#### Tier 3: Consolidated Jobs (`jobs`)
- **Purpose**: Single record per unique job across all platforms
- **Data**: Best salary ranges (min/max across platforms), merged descriptions, confidence scores
- **Intelligence**: Cross-platform job matching and data consolidation

### 2. AI-Powered Job Analysis System
**Multi-Layer Analysis:**

#### Skills Extraction & Matching
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic API for intelligent job requirement analysis
- **Skills Database**: Comprehensive skills taxonomy with synonyms and categories
- **Importance Scoring**: AI-determined skill importance per job posting
- **Gap Analysis**: User skills vs. job requirements matching

#### Career Path Intelligence
- **Classification**: Automatic career path categorization (Software Engineering, Product Management, Data Science, etc.)
- **Seniority Mapping**: Junior, Mid, Senior, Staff, Principal level detection
- **Growth Trajectory**: Career progression analysis and recommendations

#### Company Intelligence
- **Industry Classification**: Automatic industry and sub-industry categorization
- **Company Research**: Size, revenue, culture, and growth stage analysis
- **Competitive Analysis**: Salary ranges and benefits benchmarking

### 3. Content Generation System
**Modular Sentence Banking Architecture:**

#### Resume Content Library (`sentence_bank_resume`)
- **Categories**: Achievement, Skill
- **Tone Taxonomy**: Bold, Confident, Warm, Curious, Funny
- **Smart Selection**: Job attribute matching, position-specific content
- **Quality Control**: Approval workflow with strength scoring (1-10)

#### Cover Letter Content Library (`sentence_bank_cover_letter`)
- **Functional Categories**: 
  - Hook/Opening: Personal connection and attention grabbers
  - Flattery (Specific): Company-specific insights and respect
  - Alignment/Skills Fit: Connecting user traits to job needs
  - Quantified Achievement: Showcasing measurable wins
  - Narrative Proof: 2-3 sentence stories and challenges
  - Cultural Fit: Values and team collaboration
  - Future-Oriented: Growth and contribution statements
  - Closing CTA: Confident, warm sign-offs
- - **Tone Taxonomy**: Bold, Confident, Warm, Curious, Funny

#### Content Assembly Intelligence
- **Dynamic Selection**: Tag-based content matching to job requirements
- **Tone Consistency**: Tone jump scoring to maintain narrative flow
- **Personalization**: Job-specific customization while maintaining authenticity


### 4. Document Generation Engine
**Current Implementation (✅ Complete):**
- **Flexible Insertion**: Input content into any given template
- **Retain Formatting**: Preserve formatting of original reference
- **Metadata Authenticity**: Realistic revision history, professional document properties
- **Storage Integration**: Replit Object Storage with local fallback
- **Database Tracking**: Complete audit trail with UUID-based job tracking

### 5. Email Automation & Outreach
**Email System:**
- **Attachment Management**: Automatic document attachment with proper formatting
- **Tracking Integration**: Unique tracking tags for each email component

### 6. Interview Coordination
**Calendar Integration:**
- **Booking System**: Calendly scheduling 

## Database Schema Architecture

### Job Management Tables

- **Jobs (3-tier)**: Raw scrapes → Platform-specific → Consolidated records


### Content Management Tables
- **Sentence Banks**: Resume and cover letter content libraries with classification
- **Templates**: Document templates with variable fiels
- **Inserted Content**: Job-specific documents

### User Preference Tables
- **Sallary**: And total compensation
- **Commute**: and travel
- **In Office requirements**: In office, hybrid, or remote.
- **Growth**: Industry, company prestige, mentorship, leadership

### Application Tracking Tables
- **Applications**: Complete application history with outcomes
- **Email Tracking**: Individual email and link tracking
- **Interview Records**: Scheduling, preparation, and outcome tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Success rates and optimization data

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation
**Self-Contained System with advanced features:**

### System Efficiency
- **Automation Rate**: Percentage of fully automated applications
- **Processing Speed**: Time from job discovery to application sent
- **Cost per Application**: Total system cost divided by applications sent

## Risk Management & Compliance

### Platform Compliance
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping with appropriate delays

### Quality Assurance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management and recovery


## Technology Stack

### Current (Document Generation)

## Development Roadmap

### Immediate 
2. **Email Automation**: Set up email sending with tracking
4. **Content Library**: Build initial sentence banks for resume and cover letters
4. **Performance Tracking**: Refine application success metrics and analytics
5. **Content Selection**: Build algorithm for content selection based on job application
6. **User Preferences Vs Job**: Build algorithm that compares job to user's job preference. Outputs continue or break for this jbo. Do this process before selecting content for resume and cover letter
7. **Eligibility check1**: Perform small, simple eligiblity checks as early in the process to determine if the application should continue or break. Perform a email check (version 2.1) immediately after receiving the AI analyzer (this version only submits application by email).
8.  **Eligibility check2**: Perform small, simple eligiblity checks as early in the process to determine if the application should continue or break. Does the user live in the right country?
   
### Medium-term
2. **Advanced Scraping**: Multi-platform job discovery with deduplication
1. **Platform Bots**: Automated application submission on major platforms
2. **Anti-Detection**: Sophisticated bot protection and account management
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for optimization and prediction
4. **Scale Testing**: High-volume application processing and management
