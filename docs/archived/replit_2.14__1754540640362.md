# Automated Job Application System

**Version 2.14** - *Updated: July 23, 2025*

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-driven job application ecosystem that transforms the job search experience through intelligent technology. The system scrapes job postings using Apify, uses Google Gemini AI to analyze and rank opportunities with sophisticated preference packages, and generates personalized resumes and cover letters using a unified template-based approach with reference .docx files converted to variable-based templates. The database normalization is complete with optimal relational structure achieved across 32 tables.

## Communication Style

- Before implementing changes, explain what you're going to do and why
- Break down complex tasks into clear, focused steps
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Provide brief explanations for technical decisions

## Database Schema Management Policy

**CRITICAL**: Always use automated database tools instead of manual changes.

### Required Workflow:
1. Make schema changes to PostgreSQL database
2. Run: `python database_tools/update_schema.py`
3. Commit generated files to version control

### Automated Tools Usage:
- Use `python database_tools/update_schema.py` for manual updates
- Use `python database_tools/schema_automation.py --check` to check changes
- Use `python database_tools/schema_automation.py --force` for forced updates
- Use `./update_database_schema.sh` as shell wrapper

### Prohibited Actions:
- Never manually edit `frontend_templates/database_schema.html`
- Never manually edit files in `docs/component_docs/database/`
- Never manually edit files in `database_tools/generated/`
- Never skip running automation after schema changes

### Documentation Location:
- All database documentation is created in `docs/component_docs/database/`
- **[Database Schema Documentation](docs/component_docs/database/database_schema.md)** - Complete table specifications and relationships
- **[Database Normalization Summary](archived_files/docs/database_normalization_summary.md)** - Historical normalization process and achievements (archived)
- Future component documentation should follow this structure: `docs/component_docs/[component_type]/`
- Examples: `docs/component_docs/api/`, `docs/component_docs/algorithms/`, `docs/component_docs/security/`

### Enforcement:
- Pre-commit hooks prevent commits with outdated schema documentation
- Automation enforcement tools detect and require proper workflow
- Change detection system ensures documentation accuracy

## Documentation
- Add detailed inline documentation on all new or changed code. Add comprehensive docstrings and comments directly in your code that explain relationships between functions and expected behaviors.
- When new understanding of the project is gained, document the changes in replit.md
- 
## Research Preferences
- Always check for the latest versions of dependencies before suggesting updates
- Research current best practices for security implementations

## External Research Guidelines
- When suggesting new libraries, ensure compatibility with our existing stack
- Adapt external examples to match our coding standards and project structure 

## Style
- Use consistent naming patterns and code organization. Group related functions together and use clear, descriptive names.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular Flask microservice architecture with the following key design decisions:

**Flask Framework**: Chosen for its simplicity and lightweight nature, making it ideal for a focused webhook processing service.

**Modular Design**: Code is organized into separate modules within the `/modules` directory for clean separation of concerns and easy expansion.

**Blueprint Pattern**: Routes are organized using Flask blueprints to separate webhook handling logic from the main application setup.

**Base Generator Class**: Shared `BaseDocumentGenerator` class provides common functionality for all document generators (metadata, storage, formatting).

**Specialized Generators**: Individual generator classes (`ResumeGenerator`, `CoverLetterGenerator`) inherit from base class and implement specific document logic.

**Cloud Storage**: Documents are stored in Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud) with local fallback for reliability.

   * Solution: Created 8 normalized tables: job_analysis, job_skills, job_secondary_industries, job_authenticity_red_flags, job_implicit_requirements, job_cover_letter_insights, job_ats_keywords, job_red_flags  
   * Created NormalizedAnalysisWriter class for structured data storage replacing JSONB approach
   * Enhanced query performance with proper indexes on critical fields (salary range, industry, seniority, importance ratings)
   * Improved data integrity with CHECK constraints for enum values and foreign key relationships
   * Updated AI analyzer to use normalized writer with comprehensive save statistics logging
   * Fixed column name references (job_description vs description) for proper database integration
   * All AI analysis output now properly structured in relational format enabling complex queries and reporting
- July 13, 2025. **COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE NORMALIZATION**: Extended normalization to all major JSONB and array columns
   * Normalized document_tone_analysis.sentences JSONB → document_sentences table with individual sentence analysis
   * Normalized job_applications.documents_sent array → job_application_documents table
   * Normalized job_applications.tracking_data JSONB → job_application_tracking table
   * Normalized jobs.benefits array → job_benefits table
   * Normalized jobs.skills_required array → job_required_skills table
   * Database now has 28 tables total with 20 job-related tables, all properly indexed and constrained
   * Automated schema documentation system updated and confirmed working: HTML visualization and markdown docs
   * Remaining work: Complete normalization of sentence_bank arrays, user_job_preferences arrays, and jobs.platforms_found array
- July 14, 2025. **COMPLETE DATABASE NORMALIZATION**: Finished normalization of all remaining JSONB and array columns
   * Sentence bank simplification: Removed tags columns, converted matches_job_attributes arrays to single matches_job_skill VARCHAR
   * Normalized job_content_analysis.skills_analysis JSONB → job_content_skills_analysis table
   * Normalized jobs.platforms_found array → job_platforms_found table
   * Normalized cleaned_job_scrapes.original_scrape_ids array → cleaned_job_scrape_sources table
   * Normalized user_job_preferences industry arrays → user_preferred_industries table (both preferred and excluded)
   * Database now has 32 tables total with all array/JSONB columns properly normalized except raw_job_scrapes.raw_data (intentionally kept)
   * Updated content_manager.py to use simplified matches_job_skill single-skill approach
   * Documentation structure reorganized: moved all database docs to docs/component_docs/database/ and merged schema documentation
```

## Development Workflow

The project follows a structured development process for implementing new features:

### Project Command Interface (root/Makefile)

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile in the root directory that serves as the central command interface for all development tasks:

**Location Rationale**: 
- Located in project root following industry standard conventions
- Provides easy access from anywhere in the project (make commands work from root)
- Serves as project-wide command interface, not just database-specific
- Developers expect 'make help' to work from project root

**Available Commands**:
- `make db-update` - Update database schema documentation from live PostgreSQL
- `make db-check` - Check for schema changes using SHA-256 detection
- `make db-force` - Force schema update bypassing change detection
- `make db-monitor` - Real-time monitoring for schema changes
- `make test` - Run comprehensive test suite
- `make test-deps` - Test on-demand dependency loading system
- `make start` - Start application using direct Python
- `make dev` - Start with Gunicorn auto-reload
- `make help` - Display all available commands

**Architecture**: Database tools are in database_tools/ but controlled from root Makefile, testing infrastructure spans multiple directories (tests/, modules/), and all paths are relative to project root for consistency.

### Product Requirements Document (PRD) Process
- New features start with a PRD generated in `/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`
- PRDs include user stories, functional requirements, success metrics, and scope boundaries
- Clarifying questions are asked before implementation to ensure complete understanding

### Task Generation Process
- Task lists are created from PRDs as `/tasks/tasks-[prd-file-name].md`
- Tasks are broken into parent tasks with detailed sub-tasks
- Relevant files are identified for each implementation phase

### Task Implementation Protocol
- **One sub-task at a time**: Wait for user approval between sub-tasks
- **Completion sequence**: Mark sub-tasks complete → run tests → stage changes → commit → mark parent complete
- **Git commits**: Use conventional format with descriptive messages
- **Progress tracking**: Update task lists and relevant files section continuously

### Implementation Plan Template
For comprehensive integration projects, follow the structured approach demonstrated in `archived_files/INTEGRATION_STEPS_Misceres_Indeed_Scraper.md`.

For major refactoring projects, reference the versioned implementation guide `Implementation_Guide_Refactor_2_0.md` which serves as the standard template for systematic refactoring tasks:

1. **Prerequisites and Setup**
   - Environment configuration
   - Dependency installation
   - API key configuration

2. **Implementation Steps**
   - Sequential numbered steps with clear objectives
   - Code implementation with file locations
   - Testing and validation procedures

3. **Verification and Testing**
   - Unit testing with specific test cases
   - Integration testing with external services
   - Error handling and edge case validation

4. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - API documentation updates
   - Code comments and docstrings
   - Performance considerations and cost analysis

This template ensures comprehensive implementation with proper testing, documentation, and cost management for external service integrations.

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Development approach: Systematic PRD-driven feature implementation.
Task management: Sequential sub-task completion with user approval.
```

## Database Schema (Planned)

### Job Tracking Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE document_jobs (
    job_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    file_path VARCHAR(500),
    filename VARCHAR(255),
    webhook_data JSONB,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'processing',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    file_size INTEGER,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    has_error BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    error_code VARCHAR(100),
    error_message TEXT,
    error_details JSONB
);
```

**Purpose**: Track all document generation requests for audit trail and retrieval
**Key Fields**:
- `job_id`: Auto-generated UUID for unique job identification
- `file_path`: Full path to generated .docx file (NULL if error occurred)
- `filename`: Generated filename for download references (NULL if error occurred)
- `webhook_data`: Original JSON payload for debugging/regeneration
- `status`: Job status ('processing', 'completed', 'failed')
- `completed_at`: Timestamp when job finished (success or failure)
- `has_error`: Boolean flag indicating if an error occurred during processing
- `error_code`: Standardized error code for categorization
- `error_message`: Human-readable error description
- `error_details`: Additional error context in JSON format

## Development Notes

- The application uses extensive logging for debugging webhook requests
- Error handling includes proper HTTP status codes and JSON error responses
- Document generation supports various formatting options through webhook payload
- Documents stored in Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud) with local fallback
- Object storage organized with `documents/` prefix for clean organization
- Database tracking provides complete job audit trail with UUID-based job IDs
- Required webhook fields vary by document type (resume vs cover letter)
- Alternative schemas archived in database_schemas.sql for future reference
- Replit Object Storage provides cost-effective, scalable cloud storage
- Future features should follow the PRD → Task List → Implementation workflow

## Future Features (For Later Implementation)

### Hyperlink Tracking System
- **Unique tracking per instance**: Each hyperlink occurrence gets individual tracking ID, even for duplicate URLs
- **Multiple link types**: Email, LinkedIn, portfolio, calendar links each tracked separately
- **Link-to-Job mapping**: Each tracking ID associated with specific job_id for complete audit trail
- **Tracking method**: To be investigated (query strings, redirects, or other methods)
- **Database table**: Additional table needed to store tracking_id, job_id, link_type, original_url, tracking_url

### Tracking Tag Generator
- **Unique ID generation**: System to create tracking identifiers for each hyperlink instance
- **URL modification**: Mechanism to append/modify URLs with tracking information
- **Analytics integration**: Capture click events and associate with job records
- **Link validation**: Ensure tracking URLs redirect properly to original destinations
