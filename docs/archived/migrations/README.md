# Archived Migrations Documentation

**Purpose:** Historical documentation of completed migration projects

**Status:** Archived - Completed migrations, preserved for reference

## Contents

This directory contains documentation from completed migration projects:

### Replit to Docker Migration (September-October 2025)

**Files:**
- `migration-complete.md` - Comprehensive summary of Replit → Docker/Claude Code migration
- `verification-summary.md` - Verification and validation results of migration

**What Changed:**
- Development environment: Replit → Docker + VS Code devcontainer
- Storage backend: Replit Object Storage → Local filesystem with abstraction layer
- Database: Replit-hosted PostgreSQL → Dockerized PostgreSQL
- Git workflow: Replit Git UI → GitHub CLI + standard git
- Authentication: Replit secrets → .env file + environment variables

**Key Outcomes:**
- ✅ Full storage abstraction layer implemented
- ✅ Environment-aware database configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation
- ✅ Zero Replit dependencies in active code

## Why Archived

These migration documents are archived because:
1. **Migration Complete:** Projects are finished and deployed
2. **Historical Value:** Provides context for architectural decisions
3. **Reference Material:** Useful for understanding system evolution
4. **Not Current:** No longer relevant for day-to-day development

## Related Active Documentation

For current system documentation, see:
- `/docs/architecture/` - Current system architecture
- `/docs/database-connection-guide.md` - Database configuration
- `/docs/integrations/` - Active integrations
- `/modules/storage/` - Storage abstraction implementation

## Timeline

- **September 12, 2025:** Migration initiated
- **October 6, 2025:** Migration completed
- **October 7, 2025:** Post-migration cleanup completed (v4.1.0)
- **October 8, 2025:** Documentation archived

## Notes

If you're investigating historical decisions or understanding why certain patterns exist in the codebase, these documents provide valuable context about the migration from Replit to Docker.

For questions about current system configuration, refer to active documentation in `/docs/`.
