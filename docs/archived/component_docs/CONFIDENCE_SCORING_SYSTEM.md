# Confidence Scoring System Documentation

## Overview

The confidence scoring system is a comprehensive data quality assessment framework integrated into the job scraping pipeline. It evaluates the completeness and reliability of scraped job data to enable effective duplicate detection and data quality management.

## Purpose

The confidence scoring system serves multiple critical functions:

1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluates the completeness and accuracy of scraped job data
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Helps identify and merge duplicate job postings with high confidence
3. **Data Reliability**: Provides a standardized metric for assessing job data trustworthiness
4. **Pipeline Optimization**: Enables prioritization of high-quality job records

## Architecture

### Database Schema

The confidence scoring system uses two additional columns in the `cleaned_job_scrapes` table:

```sql
-- Confidence score for data quality assessment (0.00-1.00)
confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00 CHECK (confidence_score >= 0.00 AND confidence_score <= 1.00)

-- Number of duplicate raw scrapes merged into this record
duplicates_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
```

### Confidence Score Calculation

The confidence score is calculated using a weighted scoring system:

#### Critical Fields (60% of total score)
- **Job Title (30%)**: Assessed for length, specificity, and professional terminology
- **Company Name (30%)**: Evaluated for completeness and business indicators

#### Important Fields (30% of total score)
- **Job Description (15%)**: Scored based on length and content quality
- **Location (15%)**: Presence of city information

#### Additional Fields (10% of total score)
- **Salary Information (5%)**: Presence of min/max salary data
- **External Job ID (5%)**: Availability of unique job identifier

#### Bonus Scoring (up to 10%)
- **Data Completeness**: Work arrangement, job type, posting date, company website
- **Bonus Calculation**: 0.025 points per field, maximum 0.1 bonus

## Confidence Score Ranges

The system uses a four-tier confidence classification:

### High Confidence (0.8-1.0)
- **Characteristics**: Complete data with detailed descriptions
- **Use Case**: Ideal for duplicate detection and job matching
- **Quality Indicators**: Professional titles, established companies, comprehensive descriptions

### Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)
- **Characteristics**: Good data with some missing elements
- **Use Case**: Reliable for most operations with moderate confidence
- **Quality Indicators**: Basic job information present, minor gaps in data

### Low Confidence (0.4-0.6)
- **Characteristics**: Minimal data with significant gaps
- **Use Case**: Requires manual review or additional data collection
- **Quality Indicators**: Generic titles, basic company information

### Very Low Confidence (0.0-0.4)
- **Characteristics**: Insufficient data quality for reliable processing
- **Use Case**: May require rejection or extensive manual intervention
- **Quality Indicators**: Generic or missing critical information

## Quality Assessment Methods

### Title Quality Assessment
```python
def _assess_title_quality(self, title: str) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates job title quality based on:
    - Length (meaningful vs. generic)
    - Professional terminology (senior, manager, specialist)
    - Department/function identification
    - Base score: 0.5 with quality bonuses
    """
```

### Company Quality Assessment
```python
def _assess_company_quality(self, company: str) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates company name quality based on:
    - Name length and specificity
    - Business entity indicators (Inc, Corp, Ltd)
    - Generic name penalties
    - Base score: 0.5 with quality adjustments
    """
```

### Description Quality Assessment
```python
def _assess_description_quality(self, description: str) -> float:
    """
    Evaluates job description quality based on:
    - Content length (100, 300, 500 character thresholds)
    - Key section presence (responsibilities, requirements, experience)
    - Base score: 0.3 with quality bonuses
    """
```

## Duplicate Detection Integration

### Duplicate Merging Logic

When a duplicate job is detected, the system:

1. **Identifies Duplicates**: Matches on `external_job_id` and `source_website`
2. **Compares Confidence**: Uses `GREATEST(confidence_score, new_score)` to retain highest quality
3. **Updates Metadata**: Increments `duplicates_count` and updates `last_seen_timestamp`
4. **Logs Activity**: Records merge operations for audit trail

### Merge Query
```sql
UPDATE cleaned_job_scrapes 
SET original_scrape_ids = array_append(original_scrape_ids, %s),
    duplicates_count = duplicates_count + 1,
    last_seen_timestamp = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    confidence_score = GREATEST(confidence_score, %s)
WHERE cleaned_job_id = %s
```

## Pipeline Integration

### Data Flow

1. **Raw Scrape**: Job data collected from external sources
2. **Data Cleaning**: Normalization and field extraction
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment calculation
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Comparison with existing records
5. **Merge or Create**: Update existing record or create new one
6. **Statistics Tracking**: Update pipeline metrics

### Processing Statistics

The system tracks comprehensive statistics including:

- **Total Records**: Raw scrapes, cleaned jobs, active jobs
- **Quality Metrics**: Average confidence score, score distribution
- **Duplicate Handling**: Total duplicates merged, merge efficiency
- **Processing Rate**: Percentage of raw scrapes successfully processed

## API Integration

### Pipeline Statistics Endpoint

```python
@app.route('/api/pipeline-stats')
def pipeline_stats():
    """
    Returns comprehensive pipeline statistics including:
    - Raw scrape counts and success rates
    - Cleaned job totals and confidence averages
    - Duplicate merge statistics
    - Processing efficiency metrics
    """
```

### Batch Processing Endpoint

```python
@app.route('/api/process-scrapes', methods=['POST'])
def process_scrapes():
    """
    Processes raw scrapes with confidence scoring:
    - Configurable batch size
    - Real-time confidence calculation
    - Duplicate detection and merging
    - Processing result statistics
    """
```

- **Score Distribution**: Histogram of confidence scores across all jobs
- **Duplicate Efficiency**: Ratio of duplicates detected to total processed
- **Quality Trends**: Changes in average confidence over time

## Configuration Options

### Scoring Weights

The system supports configurable scoring weights:

```python
# Critical fields weight (default: 60%)
CRITICAL_FIELDS_WEIGHT = 0.6

# Important fields weight (default: 30%)
IMPORTANT_FIELDS_WEIGHT = 0.3

# Additional fields weight (default: 10%)
ADDITIONAL_FIELDS_WEIGHT = 0.1
```

### Quality Thresholds
