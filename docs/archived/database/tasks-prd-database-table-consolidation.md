# Task List: Database Table Consolidation
## Job Analysis and Analyzed Jobs Table Merger

**Based on PRD:** `prd-database-table-consolidation.md`  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** September 12, 2025  

## Overview

This task list implements the consolidation of `job_analysis` and `analyzed_jobs` tables into a single unified structure. The approach uses `analyzed_jobs` as the target table and migrates all functionality to use it exclusively.

## Relevant Files

- `modules/ai_job_description_analysis/normalized_analysis_writer.py` - Primary writer for job analysis data, needs complete migration from job_analysis to analyzed_jobs table
- `modules/ai_job_description_analysis/batch_analyzer.py` - Contains duplicate detection logic that queries job_analysis table  
- `modules/resilience/data_consistency_validator.py` - Data consistency validation with joins between tables
- `modules/workflow/application_orchestrator.py` - Main reader of analyzed job data, queries need consolidation
- `modules/content/document_generation/resume_generator.py` - Reads job analysis data for resume generation
- `modules/content/document_generation/cover_letter_generator.py` - Reads job analysis data for cover letter generation
- `modules/scraping/jobs_populator.py` - Contains duplicate detection logic that queries both tables
- `modules/matching/preference_matcher.py` - Job matching logic that accesses analysis data
- `modules/database/database_reader.py` - Database access layer that may need updates
- `database_tools/update_schema.py` - Schema automation tools that need to reflect changes
- `docs/component_docs/database/database_schema.md` - Documentation that needs updates post-migration
- `tests/test_ai_job_analysis.py` - AI analysis pipeline tests (if exists)

### Notes

- All database changes should use the existing `python database_tools/update_schema.py` automation instead of manual SQL
- Preserve all existing foreign key relationships and constraints
- User requests aggressive timeline with no backup/testing requirements for test data environment
