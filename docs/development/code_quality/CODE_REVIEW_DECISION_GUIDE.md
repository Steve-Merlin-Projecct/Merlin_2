# Code Review Decision-Making Guide

## Purpose
This guide provides a structured framework for making consistent, informed decisions during code reviews. It captures institutional knowledge and best practices to ensure future reviews maintain high standards while being efficient and effective.

## Decision Framework

### 1. Review Scope Assessment

#### When to Trigger a Full Code Review
- **New Major Features:** Any addition of >500 lines of code
- **Security Changes:** Database access, authentication, or API modifications
- **Architecture Updates:** Changes to core system design or module structure
- **Performance Issues:** Identified bottlenecks or optimization needs
- **Compliance Requirements:** Regulatory or security standard implementations
- **Team Changes:** New team members or knowledge transfer needs

#### When Limited Review is Sufficient
- **Bug Fixes:** <50 lines changed in isolated modules
- **Documentation Updates:** Non-code documentation changes
- **Configuration Tweaks:** Environment or tool configuration adjustments
- **UI/UX Polish:** Minor styling or user interface improvements

### 2. Security Decision Matrix

#### High Priority (Immediate Action Required)
- **SQL Injection Risks:** Raw SQL queries without parameterization
- **Authentication Bypass:** Unprotected routes or endpoints
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information in logs or error messages
- **Input Validation:** Missing validation on user inputs
- **Secret Management:** Hardcoded secrets or keys

**Decision Rule:** Stop all development, fix immediately, verify fix

#### Medium Priority (Address This Sprint)
- **Type Safety:** Missing type annotations on public APIs
- **Error Handling:** Insufficient error handling or recovery
- **Logging Security:** Potential information leakage in logs
- **Dependencies:** Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities

**Decision Rule:** Create tickets, assign priorities, implement within sprint

#### Low Priority (Technical Debt)
- **Code Style:** Minor formatting or naming inconsistencies
- **Documentation:** Missing or outdated inline documentation
- **Performance:** Non-critical optimization opportunities
- **Test Coverage:** Missing unit tests for edge cases

**Decision Rule:** Add to backlog, address during maintenance cycles

### 3. Code Quality Thresholds

#### Mandatory Standards (Blocking Issues)
```
- LSP Diagnostic Errors: 0 critical errors allowed
- Test Coverage: Minimum 80% for new code
- Documentation: All public APIs must have docstrings
- Security: Zero known vulnerabilities
- Formatting: 100% compliance with Black/Flake8
```

#### Quality Goals (Non-Blocking)
```
- Cyclomatic Complexity: <10 per function
- Function Length: <50 lines per function
- Class Responsibility: Single responsibility principle
- Naming Convention: Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comment Ratio: 10-20% comment to code ratio
```

### 4. Performance Decision Criteria

#### When to Optimize
- **Response Time:** >2 seconds for user-facing operations
- **Memory Usage:** >500MB increase for single feature
- **Database Queries:** N+1 query patterns identified
- **File Operations:** Synchronous I/O blocking user interface
- **Network Calls:** Unnecessary API calls or poor caching

#### Optimization Priority Matrix
| Impact | Effort | Priority | Action |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| High | Low | P0 | Immediate fix |
| High | High | P1 | Plan optimization sprint |
| Low | Low | P2 | Optimize during maintenance |
| Low | High | P3 | Document as tech debt |

### 5. Documentation Decision Points

#### Required Documentation
- **Public APIs:** Complete parameter and return documentation
- **Database Schemas:** Table and relationship documentation
- **Business Logic:** Algorithm and decision rationale
- **Security Implementations:** Authentication and authorization flows
- **Integration Points:** External API usage and error handling

#### Documentation Quality Standards
```
- Clarity: Understandable by team members not familiar with code
- Completeness: All parameters, exceptions, and side effects documented
- Currency: Updated with every code change
- Examples: Include usage examples for complex APIs
- Architecture: High-level design decisions documented
```

### 6. Refactoring Decision Framework

#### Safe Refactoring (Low Risk)
- **Naming Improvements:** Variable and function name clarification
- **Code Organization:** Moving functions between files
- **Documentation Updates:** Adding or improving comments
- **Style Consistency:** Formatting and convention alignment

#### Risky Refactoring (High Risk)
- **API Changes:** Modifying public interfaces
- **Database Schema:** Structural database modifications
- **Architecture Changes:** Core system design modifications
- **Third-party Dependencies:** Major version upgrades

#### Risk Assessment Questions
1. **Does this change affect external interfaces?**
2. **Could this impact system performance?**
3. **Are there adequate tests to verify the change?**
4. **Is the change reversible without data loss?**
5. **Does the team have sufficient expertise?**

### 7. Tool Configuration Decisions

#### Tool Selection Criteria
- **Community Adoption:** Widely used in Python ecosystem
- **Maintenance Status:** Active development and support
- **Integration:** Works well with existing development workflow
- **Configuration:** Flexible and project-appropriate settings
- **Performance:** Minimal impact on development cycle

#### Current Tool Justifications
- **Black:** Uncompromising formatter reduces style debates
- **Flake8:** Comprehensive linting with extensive rule set
- **Vulture:** Dead code detection helps maintain clean codebase
- **LSP:** Real-time error detection and code intelligence

### 8. Review Process Guidelines

#### Pre-Review Checklist
- [ ] All automated tools pass (Black, Flake8, Vulture)
- [ ] LSP diagnostics show no critical errors
- [ ] Tests pass and coverage meets threshold
- [ ] Documentation updated for changes
- [ ] Security implications assessed

#### Review Focus Areas
1. **Security:** Authentication, authorization, input validation
2. **Performance:** Database queries, algorithm efficiency, memory usage
3. **Maintainability:** Code clarity, documentation, test coverage
4. **Architecture:** Design patterns, separation of concerns
5. **Standards:** Coding conventions, naming, formatting

#### Post-Review Actions
- [ ] All review comments addressed or documented as future work
- [ ] Automated tool configuration updated if needed
- [ ] Documentation updated with any new standards or decisions
- [ ] Metrics collected for future review improvement

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Critical Security Issue Discovery
1. **Immediate:** Stop deployment, assess scope of vulnerability
2. **Within 1 Hour:** Implement temporary mitigation if possible
3. **Within 4 Hours:** Develop and test permanent fix
4. **Within 24 Hours:** Deploy fix and verify resolution
5. **Post-Incident:** Conduct review and update prevention measures

### System-Breaking Changes
1. **Immediate:** Rollback to last known good state
2. **Within 15 Minutes:** Identify root cause of failure
3. **Within 1 Hour:** Implement fix or extended rollback plan
4. **Within 4 Hours:** Verify system stability and performance
5. **Post-Incident:** Update testing and review procedures
