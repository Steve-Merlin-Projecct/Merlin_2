## Feature Breakdown by Phase

### Phase 1: Scope Detection Infrastructure ✅

**Created:** `scope-detector.sh` with pattern mappings

**Pattern mappings implemented:**
- Email/OAuth: `modules/email_integration/**`, `*oauth*.py`
- Documents: `modules/document_generation/**`
- Database: `modules/database/**`, `schema*.py`, `migrations/**`
- API: `modules/api/**`, `endpoints/**`, `routes/**`
- Dashboard/Frontend: `frontend_templates/**`
- AI/ML: `modules/ai_job_description_analysis/**`
- Scraping: `modules/scraping/**`
- Storage: `modules/storage/**`
- Testing: `tests/**`
- Documentation: `docs/**`, `*.md`

**Functions implemented:**
- `detect_scope_from_description()` - Keyword-based pattern detection
- `infer_from_worktree_name()` - Fallback scope from worktree name
- `generate_scope_json()` - Creates .worktree-scope.json manifest
- `calculate_librarian_scope()` - Inverse scope calculation
- `file_matches_scope()` - Glob pattern matching for validation
- `detect_scope_conflicts()` - Cross-worktree overlap detection

### Phase 2: Auto-Detection from Feature Names ✅

**Integration with tree.sh:**
- Sources scope-detector.sh at startup
- Calls `detect_scope_from_description()` during worktree creation
- Generates `.worktree-scope.json` for each worktree
- Updates PURPOSE.md template with scope information
- Shows first 5 patterns in PURPOSE.md

**Example output:**
```markdown
## Scope

**Automatically detected scope patterns:**

- modules/email_integration/**
- modules/email_integration/*oauth*.py
- tests/test_*email_oauth_refresh*.py
- docs/*email-oauth-refresh*.md

**Full scope details:** See `.worktree-scope.json`
```

### Phase 3: Soft Enforcement via Pre-Commit Hooks ✅

**Created:** `scope-enforcement-hook.sh`

**Features:**
- Validates all staged files against scope manifest
- Reports in-scope vs out-of-scope files
- Provides clear user feedback with worktree context
- Shows expected scope patterns
- Respects enforcement mode (soft/hard/none)

**Integration:**
- `install_scope_hook()` function in tree.sh
- Creates `.git/hooks/pre-commit` in each worktree
- Hook calls scope-enforcement-hook.sh automatically
- Made executable during worktree creation

**User experience:**
```bash
# Soft enforcement (default)
⚠️  Scope Validation Warning
The following files are outside this worktree's defined scope:
  ⚠  modules/database/schema.py

✓ Soft enforcement - proceeding with warning
```

### Phase 4: Librarian Worktree with Inverse Scope ✅

**Automatic creation:**
- Created after all feature worktrees
- Uses special branch name: `task/00-librarian`
- Always named "librarian"

**Inverse scope calculation:**
- Collects all feature worktree scope files
- Includes: docs, .claude, tools, configs, scripts
- Excludes: All patterns claimed by feature worktrees
- Generated via `calculate_librarian_scope()`

**Special PURPOSE.md:**
- Explains inverse scope concept
- Lists typical librarian files
- Notes that it excludes feature files

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- No conflicts with feature work
- Dedicated space for meta-work

### Phase 5: Hard Enforcement & Conflict Resolution ✅

**Conflict detection:**
- `detect_scope_conflicts()` in scope-detector.sh
- Identifies patterns owned by multiple worktrees
- Reports conflicts with worktree names

**New command:**
- `/tree scope-conflicts` - Manual conflict check
- Automatically runs after `/tree build`
- Shows resolution options

**Hard enforcement:**
- Edit `.worktree-scope.json`: `"enforcement": "hard"`
- Pre-commit hook blocks out-of-scope commits
- Provides resolution options to user

**Resolution strategies:**
1. Adjust patterns in scope files
2. Merge related worktrees
3. Accept overlap with soft enforcement

## Testing Results

All core functions tested and validated:

1. ✅ **Scope detection from description**: "Email OAuth" → email patterns
2. ✅ **Dashboard detection**: "Dashboard analytics" → frontend patterns
3. ✅ **Librarian scope calculation**: Correctly excludes feature patterns
4. ✅ **File matching**: In-scope files match, out-of-scope rejected
5. ✅ **Script syntax**: All scripts pass bash syntax validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Stage features with descriptive names
/tree stage Email OAuth refresh token implementation
/tree stage Dashboard analytics and user insights
/tree stage Database schema migration for profiles

# Build worktrees (auto-detects scope)
/tree build

# Result: 4 worktrees created
# 1. email-oauth-refresh (email scope)
# 2. dashboard-analytics (frontend scope)
# 3. database-schema-migration (database scope)
# 4. librarian (inverse scope - docs/tooling)
```

### Checking Conflicts

```bash
# Automatic check after build
/tree build
# Output: ✓ No scope conflicts detected

# Manual check anytime
/tree scope-conflicts
```

### Working in Worktrees

```bash
# Feature worktree
cd /workspace/.trees/email-oauth-refresh
vim modules/email_integration/oauth.py  # ✓ In scope
git commit  # ✓ Pre-commit hook passes

vim modules/database/schema.py  # ⚠ Out of scope
git commit  # ⚠ Warning shown but allowed (soft)

# Librarian worktree
cd /workspace/.trees/librarian
vim docs/api-guide.md  # ✓ In scope
vim .claude/scripts/tool.sh  # ✓ In scope
vim modules/email_integration/gmail.py  # ✗ Out of scope (excluded)
```

### Customizing Scope

```bash
# Edit scope manifest
cd /workspace/.trees/my-worktree
vim .worktree-scope.json

# Add patterns
{
  "scope": {
    "include": [
      "modules/email_integration/**",
      "modules/notifications/**"  // ← Added
    ]
  }
}

# Or change enforcement
{
  "enforcement": "hard"  // ← Block out-of-scope commits
}
```

## Benefits Delivered

1. **Prevents conflicts**: Clear boundaries reduce merge conflicts
2. **Parallel development**: Multiple developers can work safely
3. **Automatic detection**: No manual scope configuration needed
4. **Flexible enforcement**: Soft warnings or hard blocks
5. **Librarian worktree**: Dedicated space for meta-work
6. **Conflict detection**: Early warning of scope overlaps
7. **Clear documentation**: PURPOSE.md shows scope automatically

## Technical Achievements

1. **Pattern-based inference**: 12 keyword categories with file patterns
2. **Inverse scope calculation**: Librarian automatically excludes feature files
3. **Pre-commit integration**: Hooks installed automatically
4. **JSON manifest format**: Structured, extensible scope definition
5. **Glob matching**: Python-based pattern matching for accuracy
6. **Conflict detection**: Cross-worktree analysis
7. **Multi-mode enforcement**: Soft/hard/none options

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified:

1. **AI-powered detection**: Use LLM to analyze descriptions
2. **Dynamic scope expansion**: Auto-adjust when needed
3. **Visual scope browser**: Web UI for management
4. **Scope templates**: Pre-defined patterns for common features
5. **Cross-worktree analytics**: Track file change patterns
6. **Scope inheritance**: Parent-child scope relationships

## Integration Points

**Works seamlessly with:**
- `/tree build` - Automatic scope generation
- `/tree close` - Synopsis includes scope info
- `/tree closedone` - Validates scope conflicts before merge
- Git worktrees - Standard git workflow
- Pre-commit hooks - Standard git hook mechanism

**No changes needed to:**
- Existing worktrees (backward compatible)
- Main workspace workflow
- Git operations
- Claude Code integration

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible:**
- Old worktrees without `.worktree-scope.json` work normally
- Main workspace unaffected (no scope file = no enforcement)
- Can disable enforcement: `"enforcement": "none"`
- Opt-in feature (only active in new worktrees)

## Documentation Provided

   - Best practices

2. **Command documentation**: `.claude/commands/tree.md` (updated)
   - New `/tree scope-conflicts` command
   - Scope detection overview
   - Quick reference

3. **Inline documentation**: All scripts have comprehensive comments
   - Function purposes
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return values
   - Usage examples

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ **All 5 phases implemented**: Infrastructure → Auto-detection → Soft enforcement → Librarian → Hard enforcement
- ✅ **Tested and validated**: Core functions work correctly
- ✅ **Documented comprehensively**: User guide + command reference
