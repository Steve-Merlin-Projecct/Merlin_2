# /tree closedone Issues Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Operation:** Batch merge and cleanup of 11 completed worktrees
**Final Result:** 7 successfully merged, 4 skipped (empty/already merged)

---

## Problems Encountered

### 1. Git Lock File Conflicts
**Severity:** High
**Frequency:** Consistent throughout operation

**Problem:**
- Persistent `index.lock` file blocking git operations
- Error: "Unable to create '/workspace/.git/index.lock': File exists"
- Required manual removal: `rm -f /workspace/.git/index.lock`
- Occurred before nearly every git operation

**Impact:**
- Forced manual intervention 10+ times
- Broke automated workflow
- Added significant time overhead

**Root Cause:**
- Previous git operations may not have cleaned up properly
- Concurrent git operations in worktrees
- Script error paths not cleaning up locks

**Current Workaround:**
```bash
rm -f /workspace/.git/index.lock
```

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Add automatic lock cleanup in `tree.sh` before any git operation
2. Implement lock file age detection (if >60s, auto-remove)
3. Wrap all git operations in trap handlers to ensure cleanup
4. Add lock file monitoring to detect stale locks proactively

---

### 2. Empty Base Branch in Synopsis Files
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Prevented automated merging

**Problem:**
- Many synopsis files had empty "Base:" field
- Example: `# Base: ` (line 4 of user-preferences synopsis)
- Script tried to checkout empty branch name: `git checkout ""`
- Failed with: "Failed to checkout "

**Affected Worktrees:**
- user-preferences
- librarian-improvements
- dashboard-completion
- task-slash-command-refinement
- complete-calendly-integration

**Root Cause:**
- `/tree close` command not properly detecting or recording base branch
- Synopsis generation failing to capture `PURPOSE.md` base branch info
- Worktree metadata not being properly read

**Current Workaround:**
- Manual merge of each branch to known base (`develop/v4.3.2-worktrees-20251012-044136`)
- Bypassed script's base branch detection entirely

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Fix `/tree close` to ALWAYS capture base branch from:
   - Git worktree metadata: `git worktree list --porcelain`
   - PURPOSE.md file parsing
   - .claude-task-context.md parsing
2. Add validation in `/tree close` - refuse to complete if base branch empty
3. Add synopsis validation step before allowing closedone
4. Implement repair command: `/tree fix-synopsis <worktree>` to retroactively fix

---

### 3. Merge Conflicts in Workspace Config Files
**Severity:** Medium
**Frequency:** Every worktree merge

**Problem:**
- Conflicts in 4 files on every merge:
  - `.claude-init.sh`
  - `.claude-task-context.md`
  - `.claude/scripts/tree.sh`
  - `PURPOSE.md`

**Example Conflict:**
```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
echo "ðŸŒ³ Worktree: git-orchestrator-improvements"
||||||| c628e28
echo "ðŸŒ³ Worktree: dashbaord-completion-the-dashboard-needs-to-integr"
=======
echo "ðŸŒ³ Worktree: user-preferences"
>>>>>>> task/05-user-preferences
```

**Impact:**
- Required manual resolution for each merge
- Multiple nested conflict markers (3-way merge conflicts)
- `git checkout --ours` strategy didn't fully clean up markers

**Root Cause:**
- These are worktree-specific files that should NOT be in version control
- Each worktree modifies them for local context
- Git tracks them globally, causing cross-contamination

**Current Workaround:**
1. Manually resolve with `git checkout --ours`
2. Manually clean up remaining conflict markers
3. Rewrite files to main workspace values

**Proposed Solution:**
1. **Move these files to .gitignore:**
   - `.claude-init.sh` â†’ Generated per-worktree, never committed
   - `.claude-task-context.md` â†’ Generated per-worktree, never committed
   - `PURPOSE.md` â†’ Main workspace should have template only

2. **Create templates instead:**
   - `.claude/templates/init.sh.template`
   - `.claude/templates/task-context.md.template`
   - `.claude/templates/PURPOSE.md.template`

3. **Generate files on worktree creation:**
   - `/tree build` generates these from templates
   - Files never committed, always local

4. **For tree.sh conflicts:**
   - Real code changes that need proper merge
   - Implement better branch strategy (merge base â†’ worktree, not worktree â†’ base)

---

### 4. Conflict Resolution Agent Failed
**Severity:** Medium
**Frequency:** 100% failure rate

**Problem:**
```
âš  Agent-based resolution requires Claude CLI integration
âš  Conflict backups saved to: /workspace/.trees/.conflict-backup/...
âš  Agent resolution failed - manual resolution required
```

**Impact:**
- Automated conflict resolution completely non-functional
- Fell back to manual resolution every time
- Agent launch infrastructure not working

**Root Cause:**
- Agent expects Claude CLI integration that doesn't exist in current context
- Backup directory creation errors: `/workspace/.trees/.conflict-backup/.../base/.claude/scripts/tree.sh: No such file or directory`
- Agent trying to diff files before creating backup directories

**Current Workaround:**
- Manual conflict resolution with `git checkout --ours`

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Fix conflict backup directory creation:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$backup_file")"
   ```
2. Implement fallback strategies:
   - Strategy 1: Auto-accept main workspace version (--ours)
   - Strategy 2: Auto-accept incoming changes (--theirs)
   - Strategy 3: Skip and mark for manual resolution
3. Remove agent dependency for simple conflicts
4. Only invoke agent for complex, multi-file conflicts

### 5. No Commits to Merge (After Manual Merge)
**Severity:** Low
**Frequency:** Every worktree after manual merge

**Problem:**
```
â„¹ No commits to merge (cleanup only)
```

**Impact:**
- Worktrees already manually merged showed as "no commits"
- Script correctly cleaned up worktrees/branches
- Minor: confusing messaging

**Root Cause:**
- Manual merge completed before running closedone
- Script correctly detected commits already merged
- Not really a problem, just informational

**Proposed Solution:**
- Improve messaging: "Already merged - cleaning up only"
- Add detection: "Detected X commits already merged manually"

---

### 6. Duplicate Worktree Entries
**Severity:** Low
**Problem:**
- Same worktree appeared multiple times in discovery:
  - task-slash-command-refinement appeared 3 times
  - git-orchestrator-improvements appeared 2 times

**Root Cause:**
- Multiple synopsis files for same worktree (from different completion times)
- Script processed each synopsis file separately
- No deduplication logic

**Current Workaround:**
- Script handled gracefully (already removed worktrees showed warnings)

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Deduplicate by worktree name, not synopsis filename
2. Use most recent synopsis file if multiple exist
3. Warn about duplicate synopses: "Found 3 synopses for task-slash-command-refinement, using most recent"

---

### 7. Branch Not Found Errors
**Severity:** Low
**Problem:**
```
âš  Branch not found:  (skipping apply-assistant)
âš  Branch not found:  (skipping gemini-prompt-optimization---reduce-costs-30-40-im)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Synopsis files with empty branch names
- Worktrees created but never properly initialized
- Incomplete metadata in synopsis files

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add synopsis validation on creation
- Refuse to create synopsis if critical fields missing
- Implement `/tree validate` to check all synopses

---

## Implementation Notes

### Quick Wins (can implement immediately)
```bash
# In tree.sh, before any git operation:
cleanup_git_locks() {
    local lock_file="/workspace/.git/index.lock"
    if [ -f "$lock_file" ]; then
        local age=$(($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$lock_file" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)))
        if [ "$age" -gt 60 ]; then
            rm -f "$lock_file"
            print_info "Removed stale git lock (${age}s old)"
        fi
    fi
}
```

### Files to Add to .gitignore
```
.claude-init.sh
.claude-task-context.md
PURPOSE.md  # Only in worktrees, not main workspace
```

### Synopsis Validation Schema
```bash
validate_synopsis() {
    local synopsis_file=$1

    # Required fields
    grep -q "^# Branch: .\\+" "$synopsis_file" || return 1
    grep -q "^# Base: .\\+" "$synopsis_file" || return 1
    grep -q "^# Completed: .\\+" "$synopsis_file" || return 1

    return 0
}
```
