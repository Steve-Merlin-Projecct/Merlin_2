## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Automated Job Application System requires a robust database solution to handle:
- Complex relational data across 32+ normalized tables
- Job postings, user data, application tracking, and analysis results
- High data integrity requirements for job application workflows
- Advanced querying capabilities for job matching and analysis
- Support for automated schema management and migrations
- Integration with Replit's hosting environment

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database system, specifically leveraging Replit's managed PostgreSQL service (Neon-backed).

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **ACID Compliance**: Full transactional integrity for critical job application data
- **Advanced Features**: Support for JSON columns, full-text search, and complex queries
- **Scalability**: Proven performance for applications of our scale
- **Schema Management**: Excellent support for migrations and schema evolution
- **Replit Integration**: Seamless integration with Replit's infrastructure
- **Automated Backups**: Built-in backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Developer Experience**: Rich ecosystem of tools and excellent Python support via psycopg2

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: More complex than NoSQL alternatives for simple operations
- **Resource Usage**: Higher memory and CPU requirements than lightweight alternatives
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs PostgreSQL-specific knowledge for optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: SQLite
- **Description**: Lightweight, file-based relational database
- **Pros**: Simple deployment, no server management, excellent for development
- **Cons**: Limited concurrent write support, no network access, challenging backup/replication
- **Decision**: Rejected due to multi-user access requirements and scalability concerns

### Alternative 2: MySQL
- **Description**: Popular open-source relational database
- **Pros**: Wide adoption, good performance, familiar to many developers
- **Cons**: Less advanced features than PostgreSQL, licensing considerations, weaker JSON support
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of PostgreSQL's advanced features and better Replit integration

### Alternative 3: MongoDB
- **Description**: Document-oriented NoSQL database
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, excellent for rapid prototyping, built-in sharding
- **Cons**: No ACID transactions across documents, complex relationships difficult to model, less mature ecosystem for our use case
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complex relational requirements and need for strong consistency

### Alternative 4: Supabase
- **Description**: PostgreSQL-based Backend-as-a-Service
- **Pros**: PostgreSQL foundation with additional features, real-time subscriptions
- **Cons**: Additional vendor dependency, potential cost implications, less control over infrastructure
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of Replit's native PostgreSQL offering for better integration

## Implementation Notes
- Use Replit's managed PostgreSQL service for production
- Implement database connection pooling for optimal performance
- Utilize SQLAlchemy ORM for type safety and migration management
- Create automated schema management tools for consistency
- Implement proper indexing strategy for job search and analysis queries
