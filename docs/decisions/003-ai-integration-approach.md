## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system requires sophisticated AI analysis capabilities for:
- Job description analysis and skill extraction
- Resume optimization recommendations
- Job matching and ranking algorithms
- Content generation assistance
- Automated quality scoring and feedback

Key requirements:
- High-quality natural language understanding
- Structured output for system integration
- Cost-effective pricing for high-volume usage
- Reliable API with good uptime
- Security and privacy compliance

## Decision
We will use Google Gemini AI as our primary AI analysis engine, specifically the Gemini Pro model for comprehensive job analysis tasks.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Advanced Capabilities**: State-of-the-art natural language understanding
- **Structured Output**: Excellent support for JSON-formatted responses
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Competitive pricing with generous free tier (1,500 requests/day)
- **Google Integration**: Seamless integration with Google's ecosystem
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance standards
- **Multi-modal Support**: Potential for future image/document analysis
- **Reliability**: Google's infrastructure ensures high uptime

### Negative Consequences
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on Google's AI services
- **Rate Limiting**: Free tier limitations may require paid upgrades
- **API Changes**: Potential for breaking changes in AI model updates
- **Data Privacy**: External service processes job and personal data

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Description**: OpenAI's flagship language model
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, wide adoption, strong ecosystem
- **Cons**: Higher cost per request, rate limiting, potential availability issues
- **Decision**: Rejected due to cost considerations and rate limiting concerns

### Alternative 2: Anthropic Claude
- **Description**: Anthropic's constitutional AI model
- **Pros**: Strong safety features, good reasoning capabilities, helpful for complex analysis
- **Cons**: More expensive, less integrated ecosystem, newer service
- **Decision**: Rejected due to cost and integration complexity

### Alternative 3: Open Source Models (Llama, Mistral)
- **Description**: Self-hosted open source language models
- **Pros**: Full control, no external dependencies, potentially lower long-term costs
- **Cons**: Significant infrastructure requirements, model maintenance, lower performance
- **Decision**: Rejected due to infrastructure complexity and resource requirements

### Alternative 4: Azure OpenAI
- **Description**: OpenAI models hosted on Microsoft Azure
- **Pros**: Enterprise features, better compliance, stable pricing
- **Cons**: Higher costs, complex setup, Microsoft ecosystem dependency
- **Decision**: Rejected due to setup complexity and cost considerations

## Implementation Notes
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Use structured prompts for consistent JSON output
- Implement rate limiting and usage tracking
- Add circuit breaker patterns for service resilience
- Multi-layered security protection against LLM injection attacks
- Batch processing capabilities for efficiency
- Usage monitoring and cost tracking
