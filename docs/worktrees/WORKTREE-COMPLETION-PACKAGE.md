ADD COLUMN ats_score DECIMAL(5,2);

ALTER TABLE sentence_bank_cover_letter
ADD COLUMN optimization_round INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN optimization_date TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN quality_score DECIMAL(5,2),
ADD COLUMN ats_score DECIMAL(5,2);
```

### Agent Configuration
**Copywriter Agent Settings**:
```yaml
agent_type: copywriter
batch_size: 50  # Process 50 sentences per batch

round_configs:
  - name: professional_accuracy
    focus: grammar, terminology, consistency
    validation: style_guide_check
  - name: compensation_optimization
    focus: value, impact, leadership
    validation: compensation_scoring
  - name: recruiter_optimization
    focus: keywords, ats, scanability
    validation: ats_scoring
```

### Tools & Scripts
**Processing Pipeline**:
1. `extract_sentences.py` - Pull sentences from database
2. `batch_copywriter.py` - Batch process through agent
3. `validate_quality.py` - Run quality checks
4. `update_database.py` - Write optimized sentences back
5. `generate_report.py` - Create quality metrics report

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Accidental overwrite of original sentences
   - **Mitigation**: Backup before any modifications
   - **Contingency**: Restore from backup immediately

2. **Agent Failure**: Copywriter agent errors mid-process
   - **Mitigation**: Batch processing with checkpoints
   - **Contingency**: Resume from last successful batch

3. **Quality Degradation**: Optimized sentences worse than originals
   - **Mitigation**: Validation checks after each round
   - **Contingency**: Revert to previous round's output

### Medium Priority Risks
4. **Time Overrun**: Process exceeds 12-hour estimate
   - **Mitigation**: Track progress, optimize batch sizes
   - **Contingency**: Extend timeline or reduce scope

5. **Schema Changes**: New columns break existing code
   - **Mitigation**: Test schema changes in isolation
   - **Contingency**: Schema rollback capability

### Low Priority Risks
6. **Performance Impact**: Database queries slow down
   - **Mitigation**: Index optimization, query profiling
   - **Contingency**: Query optimization or caching
