- [ ] Generate coverage report: `pytest --cov=modules --cov-report=html`
- [ ] Review coverage report: `open htmlcov/index.html`
- [ ] Check CI/CD status on GitHub
- [ ] List any flaky or failing tests
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### During the Review
- [ ] Review coverage numbers vs targets
- [ ] Discuss test quality and maintainability
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline effectiveness
- [ ] Identify remaining gaps
- [ ] Prioritize next steps
- [ ] Update documentation

### After the Review
- [ ] Document decisions made

## Commands for Review

### Run Tests
```bash
# Full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=modules --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Check for flaky tests (run 10 times)
for i in {1..10}; do pytest tests/ -x || break; done
```

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Overall coverage
coverage report

# By module
coverage report --include="modules/email_integration/*"
coverage report --include="modules/workflow/*"
coverage report --include="modules/resilience/*"

# Show missing lines
coverage report -m
```

### CI/CD Status
```bash
# Check recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>
```
