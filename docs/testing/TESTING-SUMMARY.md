## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Working Well
- **Circuit Breaker:** 78% coverage, all 34 tests passing
- **Security Scanner:** 68-83% coverage, good test quality
- **Document Generation:** Core features well-tested
- **Test Infrastructure:** Excellent fixtures and organization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
- **Email System:** 0% coverage (1,416 lines untested)
- **Workflow:** 0% coverage (771 lines untested)
- **Dashboard:** 0% coverage (261 lines untested)
- **Analytics:** 0% coverage (189 lines untested)
- **Integration Tests:** Most failing (63 failures)

### üî¥ Blocking Issues
1. API signature mismatches in resilience tests
2. Import errors in 2 test files
3. Integration test failures (sequential batch, calendly, dashboard)
4. 24 modules with zero test coverage

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Fix API mismatches in resilience modules
2. Resolve import errors
3. Document known test failures

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
4. Add email integration tests (target: 70% coverage)
5. Add workflow tests (target: 65% coverage)
6. Fix integration test failures

### Medium-term (Next 4-6 Weeks)
7. Add resilience system tests
8. Add database operation tests
9. Add storage backend tests
10. Add dashboard and analytics tests

### Long-term (Next 2 Months)
11. Achieve 95% overall coverage
12. Establish CI/CD testing pipeline
13. Create comprehensive E2E test suite
