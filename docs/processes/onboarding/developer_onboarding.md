## Overview
Complete onboarding process for new developers joining the Automated Job Application System development team.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Developer has signed employment/contractor agreement
- [ ] IT equipment provisioned (laptop, accounts, etc.)
- [ ] Basic development tools installed (Git, Python, etc.)
- [ ] Replit account created and verified

## Participants
- **Primary**: New Developer
- **Mentor**: Assigned Senior Developer
- **Team Lead**: Onboarding oversight and approvals
- **DevOps**: Access provisioning

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Account Setup & Access
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

1. **Replit Environment Setup**
   - Add developer to team Replit organization
   - Grant access to development and staging workspaces
   - Verify developer can access main codebase
   **Verification**: Developer can successfully open and run the application

2. **Development Tool Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd automated-job-application-system
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Set up development environment
   python setup_dev_environment.py
   ```
   **Expected Result**: Local development environment running successfully

3. **Access Provisioning**
   - Database access (development environment only initially)
   - API keys for development/staging
   - Documentation access
   - Communication channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)
   **Note**: Production access granted after probationary period

### Phase 2: Codebase Orientation  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

4. **Architecture Overview Session**
   - Review system architecture documentation
   - Walk through major components and data flow
   - Understand security implementation
   - Review coding standards and best practices
   **Resources**: 
   - [System Architecture](../../architecture/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - [Coding Standards](../../development/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md)

5. **Database Schema Deep Dive**
   - Review database schema documentation
   - Understand table relationships and constraints
   - Learn about automated schema management
   - Practice running database tools
   **Hands-on**: Run schema generation tools, explore database

6. **Development Workflow Training**
   - Git workflow and branching strategy
   - Code review process
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment procedures
   **Practice**: Make a small test change and walk through full workflow

### Phase 3: Hands-On Learning
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

7. **First Development Task**
   - Assign a small, well-defined "starter" issue
   - Should touch multiple parts of the system
   - Mentor provides guidance but developer leads
   **Example Tasks**:
   - Add a new field to job analysis
   - Improve error handling in specific module
   - Add a simple API endpoint

8. **Code Review Participation**
   - Observe code reviews for first week
   - Start providing feedback on simple changes
   - Understand quality standards and expectations
   **Goal**: Feel comfortable participating in code review process

9. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Learn testing frameworks and patterns used
   - Practice writing unit tests
   - Understand integration testing approach
   - Run automated testing tools
   ```bash
   # Run test suite
   python -m pytest tests/
   
   # Run linting tools
   flake8 modules/
   black modules/
   ```

### Phase 4: System Integration
**Estimated Time**: 1 week

10. **Component Deep Dives**
    - Spend focused time on each major component
    - Understand component interactions
    - Practice debugging common issues
    **Schedule**: One component per day over a week

11. **Security Training**
    - Review security implementation guide
    - Understand authentication and authorization
    - Learn about data protection measures
    - Practice secure coding patterns
    **Resources**: [Security Overview](../../component_docs/security/security_overview.md)

12. **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**
    - Learn monitoring tools and dashboards
    - Practice troubleshooting common issues
    - Understand incident response procedures
    **Hands-on**: Simulate and resolve common problems
