## Overview
Complete procedure for deploying the Automated Job Application System to the production environment on Replit.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Code changes merged to `main` branch
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] Security scan completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Database migrations prepared and tested
- [ ] Staging deployment completed and verified
- [ ] Production deployment approval obtained

## Participants
- **Primary**: DevOps Engineer
- **Secondary**: Lead Developer
- **Approvers**: Team Lead, Product Owner
- **Notified**: Development Team, Stakeholders

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Verification
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

1. **Verify Staging Environment**
   ```bash
   # Check staging application health
   curl -f https://staging-app.replit.app/health
   ```
   **Expected Result**: HTTP 200 with health status OK
   **Verification**: Application responds and all services are operational

2. **Confirm Database Migration Status**
   ```bash
   # Check pending migrations
   python database_tools/check_migrations.py --env=production
   ```
   **Expected Result**: List of pending migrations or "No pending migrations"
   **Note**: Review migration plan if migrations are pending

3. **Backup Production Database**
   ```bash
   # Create pre-deployment backup
   python database_tools/backup_database.py --env=production --tag=pre-deployment-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```
   **Verification**: Backup completed successfully and stored

### Phase 2: Deployment Execution
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

4. **Deploy Application Code**
   - Navigate to Replit production workspace
   - Ensure latest code is pulled from `main` branch
   - Restart the application workflow
   ```bash
   # In Replit console
   git pull origin main
   # Restart workflow through Replit interface
   ```
   **Expected Result**: Application restarts successfully
   **Warning**: Monitor logs for any startup errors

5. **Execute Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   # Run pending migrations
   python database_tools/run_migrations.py --env=production
   ```
   **Expected Result**: All migrations execute successfully
   **Rollback**: Migration rollback scripts available if needed

6. **Update Environment Configuration**
   - Verify all environment variables are current
   - Update any configuration that changed
   **Note**: Use Replit Secrets management for sensitive values

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Verification
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

7. **Health Check Verification**
   ```bash
   # Comprehensive health check
   curl -f https://production-app.replit.app/health
   curl -f https://production-app.replit.app/api/health
   ```
   **Expected Result**: All endpoints return healthy status

8. **Critical Path Testing**
   - Test job scraping functionality
   - Test AI analysis workflow
   - Test document generation
   - Test email integration
   **Verification**: All critical features working as expected

9. **Performance Monitoring Check**
   - Verify monitoring systems are receiving data
   - Check response times are within acceptable ranges
   - Review error rates in logs
   **Expected Result**: Performance metrics within normal ranges

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application health checks passing
- [ ] Database migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Critical functionality verified
- [ ] No critical errors in application logs
- [ ] Monitoring systems showing normal metrics
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of successful deployment

## Rollback Procedure
If deployment fails or issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop traffic to new deployment
   - Switch to previous stable version

2. **Database Rollback** (if migrations were run)
   ```bash
   # Rollback database migrations
   python database_tools/rollback_migrations.py --env=production --to-version=[previous_version]
   ```

3. **Application Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous git commit
   git checkout [previous_stable_commit]
   # Restart application
   ```

4. **Verification**
   - Run health checks on rolled-back version
   - Verify critical functionality works
   - Notify stakeholders of rollback

## Communication Plan
- **Before Starting**: Notify development team and stakeholders
- **During Process**: Real-time updates in deployment channel
- **Upon Completion**: Send completion notification with deployment summary
- **If Issues Occur**: Immediate notification with impact assessment

## Monitoring & Alerts
- **Duration**: Typical deployment takes 35 minutes
- **Success Rate**: Target 95% successful deployments
- **Key Metrics**: Response time, error rate, user activity
- **Alerts**: Critical alerts monitored for 2 hours post-deployment
