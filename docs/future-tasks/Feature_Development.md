# Tasks Directory

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and task lists for feature development.

## File Structure

- `prd-[feature-name].md` - Product Requirements Documents
- `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` - Implementation task lists

## Workflow

1. Create PRD with clarifying questions
2. Generate task list from PRD
3. Implement tasks one sub-task at a time
4. Update progress and commit changes systematically

See `replit.md` for complete development workflow details.

When features of priority: critical, high, medium, low are implemented, tested and running consitently, We can begin developing more features. Only review or act on the following after getting complete and clear confirmation from project leader, Steve Glen.

## Future Phase Features
1. Template files will be stored in the format of XML files within folders, instead of docx files

I have structured data, are there any actors on apify that can fill out forms and apply for jobs for me on indeed.ca?
Yes! Apify offers several actors (pre-built web scraping and automation tools) that can help with filling out forms and applying for jobs on Indeed.ca or other job boards. Here are a few options:

1. Apify Actors for Form Filling & Job Applications
While there isn't a pre-made actor specifically for Indeed.ca applications, you can use generic automation tools to achieve this:

Web Scraper – Can extract job listings from Indeed.

Form Filling & Submission – A tool to automate form submissions.

Puppeteer Scraper – Allows custom JavaScript/Puppeteer automation to interact with forms.

2. Custom Solution with Apify + Puppeteer/Playwright
If you need a tailored solution, you can build a custom actor using:

Apify SDK + Puppeteer/Playwright to automate job applications.

You can simulate clicks, fill out forms, and even handle CAPTCHAs (though Indeed may have anti-bot measures).

3. External Automation Tools
If Apify doesn’t have a ready-made solution, you might consider:

Zapier/Make (Integromat) + Apify for workflow automation.

Browserless.io (headless browser automation).
