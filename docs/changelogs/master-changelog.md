Historical Changelog:
- October 06, 2025. **INFRASTRUCTURE**: Implemented environment-aware database configuration for Docker/local development
  * Created database_config.py with automatic Docker vs local environment detection
  * Updated database_client.py to use environment-aware connection logic with fallback support
  * Added intelligent connection priority: DATABASE_URL → individual components → fallback defaults
  * Docker detection checks DATABASE_HOST, containerEnv variables, and /.dockerenv file
  * Local environment automatically uses localhost with PGPASSWORD from .env
  * Created comprehensive test script (test_db_connection.py) for connection verification
  * Updated .env with detailed configuration documentation and options
  * Created complete Database Connection Guide (docs/database-connection-guide.md)
  * Successfully migrated from Replit-specific hardcoded DATABASE_URL to flexible configuration
  * Verified connection working in Docker container with host.docker.internal
  * All database operations now support both environments transparently
- June 30, 2025. Initial setup
- July 01, 2025. Fixed empty attachment issue in email integration
  * Updated download endpoint to use direct Response mechanism instead of send_file with BytesIO
  * Added explicit Content-Length header to ensure proper file transfer
  * Reinstated API authentication with WEBHOOK_API_KEY
  * Optimized cloud-first storage approach with no local file retention
- July 01, 2025. **MILESTONE**: Service fully operational for production use
- August 07, 2025. **SECURITY ENHANCEMENT**: Implemented comprehensive replit.md change monitoring system
  * Created character-level change detection script with Git integration
  * Built automated monitoring system that logs every modification to replit.md
  * Added SHA256 hash-based file integrity verification
  * Implemented entity tracking to distinguish between user and agent changes
  * Created detailed changelog system with timestamps and diff analysis
  * Added protection markers to critical sections of replit.md configuration
  * Established secure audit trail for all configuration changes
- August 20, 2025. **CODE CLEANUP**: Completed terminology standardization for auto-restore system
  * Implemented a system that would restore the protected content in replit.md if it was changed by the agent. This system would also store the protected system if the change was made by the user. This way, the user's wishes are always up to date in replit.md
  * Initally named the system "roomba", but then renamed the system afterwards
- September 03, 2025. **ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT**: Modularized auto-restore protection system
  * Split auto-restore functionality into separate module (tools/auto_restore_protection.py)
  * Improved code organization and separation of concerns
  * Enhanced monitor system to display complete change logs without truncation
  * Maintained backward compatibility while improving maintainability
- September 12, 2025. **DATABASE CONSOLIDATION**: Successfully consolidated job_analysis and analyzed_jobs tables
  * **Phase 1**: Completed schema analysis and preparation (DB-1.1, DB-1.2, DB-1.3)
  * **Phase 2**: Completed code inventory and impact analysis (DB-2.1, DB-2.2, DB-2.3)
  * **Phase 3**: Completed database schema migration (DB-3.1, DB-3.2)
    - Added 6 missing columns to analyzed_jobs table (job_id, hiring_manager, reporting_to, job_title_extracted, company_name_extracted, additional_insights)
    - Optimized table structure with performance indexes and foreign key constraints
  * **Phase 4**: Completed code migration and updates (DB-4.1 through DB-4.8)
    - Updated normalized_analysis_writer.py to write only to analyzed_jobs
    - Updated batch_analyzer.py duplicate detection logic
    - Updated data_consistency_validator.py join operations
    - Updated application_orchestrator.py to read only from analyzed_jobs
    - Verified document generation and preference matching modules
    - Updated jobs_populator.py duplicate detection logic
    - Eliminated all remaining job_analysis references from active code
  * **Phase 5**: Completed data migration and final steps (DB-5.1 through DB-5.5)
    - No data migration required (job_analysis table was empty)
    - Verified data integrity and functional testing across all systems
    - Successfully dropped job_analysis table from database
    - Updated all database schema documentation and generated files
    - Final validation confirmed all functionality preserved
  * **RESULT**: Single unified analyzed_jobs table eliminates data redundancy while maintaining all functionality
  * **IMPACT**: Simplified codebase complexity, improved performance, cleaner database schema
  * **REFERENCE**: development documentation archived to docs/archived/database/prd-database-table-consolidation.md and docs/archived/database/tasks-prd-database-table-consolidation.md
