  * Created modular storage backend system (modules/storage/) with abstract base class
  * Implemented LocalStorageBackend for filesystem-based document storage
  * Created storage factory pattern for runtime backend selection via environment variables
  * Migrated document_generator.py from Replit Object Storage to new storage abstraction

  * Added STORAGE_BACKEND and LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH environment variables
  * Created .env.example with comprehensive storage configuration documentation
  * Updated CLAUDE.md to remove Replit references and document new storage architecture
  * Verified zero import errors and successful module loading
  * All tests passing - storage backend fully functional
  * System now platform-agnostic and ready for cloud provider integration (AWS S3, GCS)
- October 06, 2025. **INFRASTRUCTURE**: Implemented environment-aware database configuration for Docker/local development
  * Created database_config.py with automatic Docker vs local environment detection
  * Updated database_client.py to use environment-aware connection logic with fallback support
  * Added intelligent connection priority: DATABASE_URL → individual components → fallback defaults
  * Docker detection checks DATABASE_HOST, containerEnv variables, and /.dockerenv file
  * Local environment automatically uses localhost with PGPASSWORD from .env
  * Created comprehensive test script (test_db_connection.py) for connection verification
  * Updated .env with detailed configuration documentation and options
  * Created complete Database Connection Guide (docs/database-connection-guide.md)
  * Successfully migrated from Replit-specific hardcoded DATABASE_URL to flexible configuration
  * Verified connection working in Docker container with host.docker.internal
  * All database operations now support both environments transparently

  * Maintained backward compatibility while improving maintainability
- September 12, 2025. **DATABASE CONSOLIDATION**: Successfully consolidated job_analysis and analyzed_jobs tables
  * **Phase 1**: Completed schema analysis and preparation (DB-1.1, DB-1.2, DB-1.3)
  * **Phase 2**: Completed code inventory and impact analysis (DB-2.1, DB-2.2, DB-2.3)
  * **Phase 3**: Completed database schema migration (DB-3.1, DB-3.2)
    - Added 6 missing columns to analyzed_jobs table (job_id, hiring_manager, reporting_to, job_title_extracted, company_name_extracted, additional_insights)
    - Optimized table structure with performance indexes and foreign key constraints
  * **Phase 4**: Completed code migration and updates (DB-4.1 through DB-4.8)
    - Updated normalized_analysis_writer.py to write only to analyzed_jobs
    - Updated batch_analyzer.py duplicate detection logic
    - Updated data_consistency_validator.py join operations
    - Updated application_orchestrator.py to read only from analyzed_jobs
    - Verified document generation and preference matching modules
    - Updated jobs_populator.py duplicate detection logic
    - Eliminated all remaining job_analysis references from active code
  * **Phase 5**: Completed data migration and final steps (DB-5.1 through DB-5.5)
    - No data migration required (job_analysis table was empty)
    - Verified data integrity and functional testing across all systems
    - Successfully dropped job_analysis table from database
    - Updated all database schema documentation and generated files
    - Final validation confirmed all functionality preserved
  * **RESULT**: Single unified analyzed_jobs table eliminates data redundancy while maintaining all functionality
  * **IMPACT**: Simplified codebase complexity, improved performance, cleaner database schema
  * **REFERENCE**: development documentation archived to docs/archived/database/prd-database-table-consolidation.md and docs/archived/database/tasks-prd-database-table-consolidation.md
