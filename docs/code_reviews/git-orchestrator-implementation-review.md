   - Plan: Integrate after branch merge

2. **Commit Type Inference:** 90% accuracy target (manual override available)
   - Enhancement: Analyze diff content, not just filenames
   - Timeline: Phase 6 (post-V1)

3. **Changelog Automation:** Template generation only
   - Enhancement: Full ML-based generation
   - Timeline: Phase 7 (post-V1)

4. **Custom Commit Templates:** Not supported
   - Enhancement: User-defined templates
   - Timeline: Phase 2 enhancement

---

### Future Enhancements Roadmap

**Worktree Management (Post-Merge):**
- Worktree status dashboard
- Automated merge operations
- Conflict detection and reporting

**Advanced Intelligence (Phase 6):**
- Enhanced commit type inference (95%+ accuracy)
- Pre-emptive validation
- Smart checkpoint timing

**Advanced Automation (Phase 7):**
- Automatic changelog generation
- Semantic versioning suggestions
- PR description generation

**Integration Enhancements (Phase 8):**

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Declarative Implementation:** Agent specification as implementation reduced complexity
2. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Three-level docs (agent spec, integration guide, user guide) cover all audiences
3. **Error Recovery:** Checkpoint fallback strategy ensures progress never lost
4. **Integration Design:** Minimal handoff burden on primary agent
5. **Design Decisions:** Early resolution of open questions prevented rework

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Testing:** No automated tests for agent logic (relies on specification correctness)
2. **Performance Validation:** Targets specified but not empirically measured
3. **Real-World Validation:** No production usage data yet

### Recommendations for Future Agents

1. **Start with PRD:** Comprehensive requirements prevent scope creep
2. **Document Three Levels:** Agent spec, integration guide, user guide
3. **Plan Error Recovery:** Fallback strategies for every failure mode
4. **Optimize for Tokens:** Declarative specs more efficient than procedural code
5. **Integrate Early:** Consider existing automation and workflows from day one
