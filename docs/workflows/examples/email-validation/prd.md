# PRD: Email Validation System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Example / Template
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude Code)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The email validation system will provide robust, RFC-compliant email address validation across the job application platform. Currently, the system accepts any string as an email address, leading to failed email deliveries and poor data quality.

### Problem Statement
Invalid email addresses are being stored in the database, causing:
- Email delivery failures (bounce rate ~15%)
- Support tickets from users who can't receive notifications
- Wasted API calls to email service providers
- Poor data quality for analytics

### Proposed Solution
Implement multi-layer email validation including:
- Format validation (RFC 5322 compliance)
- Domain verification (DNS MX record checks)
- Disposable email detection
- Real-time validation feedback in UI

### Success Criteria
- Email bounce rate reduced from 15% to <2%
- 99.9% of valid emails accepted
- <1% false positive rejection rate
- Validation response time <200ms

## 2. Goals

1. **Reduce email bounce rate to <2%** within 30 days of deployment
2. **Validate 100% of new email addresses** at registration and profile update
3. **Maintain fast validation** with <200ms average response time
4. **Provide clear user feedback** when email addresses are rejected

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**US1:** As a new user, I want to receive immediate feedback on my email address validity so that I don't waste time with an invalid email.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Email validation occurs on blur (when user leaves email field)
- [ ] Clear error message displays within 200ms
- [ ] Error message explains what's wrong (e.g., "Invalid format" vs "Domain doesn't exist")
- [ ] Valid emails show green checkmark

**US2:** As a system administrator, I want to prevent disposable email addresses so that we maintain a high-quality user base.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Common disposable email domains are blocked (10minutemail.com, guerrillamail.com, etc.)
- [ ] Blacklist is updateable without code deployment
- [ ] Rejected emails log reason for admin review
- [ ] Override mechanism exists for legitimate edge cases

**US3:** As a user, I want my organization's email domain to be accepted even if it has unusual formatting, so I can use my work email.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] RFC 5322 compliant emails are accepted
- [ ] International domain names (IDN) are supported
- [ ] Plus addressing (user+tag@domain.com) is allowed
- [ ] Quoted strings and special characters handled correctly

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements (Must Have)

**FR1:** System must validate email format according to RFC 5322 standard
- **Details:** Support standard formats, quoted strings, comments, internationalized addresses
- **Validation:** Unit tests with RFC test vectors

**FR2:** System must verify domain DNS MX records exist
- **Details:** Query DNS for MX records before accepting email
- **Validation:** Test with valid/invalid domains

**FR3:** System must reject disposable email domains
- **Details:** Maintain blacklist of known disposable email providers
- **Validation:** Test with known disposable domains

**FR4:** System must provide real-time validation feedback in UI
- **Details:** Validate on field blur, show status within 200ms
- **Validation:** Measure validation response times

**FR5:** System must store validation results and timestamps
- **Details:** Track when email was validated, method used, result
- **Validation:** Verify database records created

### Extended Requirements (Should Have)

**FR6:** System should detect typos in common email domains
- **Details:** Suggest corrections for gnail.com ‚Üí gmail.com
- **Validation:** Test with common typos

**FR7:** System should cache validation results to improve performance
- **Details:** Cache valid domains for 24 hours
- **Validation:** Verify cache hit rate >80%

### Optional Requirements (Nice to Have)

**FR8:** System could integrate with email verification services (ZeroBounce, NeverBounce)
- **Details:** Optional paid verification for critical workflows
- **Validation:** Test integration if implemented

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Email deliverability checking** - We validate format and domain, but don't verify the specific mailbox exists (deferred to future enhancement)
2. **Bulk email validation** - This is for real-time UI validation only, not batch processing
3. **Email reputation checking** - Not checking if domain is associated with spam
4. **Historical email correction** - Only validating new/updated emails, not retroactively fixing existing data

**Rationale:** These features require third-party paid services and significantly increase complexity. They can be added as Phase 2 enhancements.

## 6. Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Inline validation on blur (not on every keystroke)
- Clear, helpful error messages
- Green checkmark for valid emails
- Suggested corrections for common typos
- No blocking during validation (async)

### Visual Design
- Follow existing form validation patterns
- Use consistent error/success colors
- Position error message below input field
- Match existing input field styling

### User Flow
```
1. User enters email address in input field
2. User tabs/clicks away (blur event)
3. System shows loading indicator (spinner icon)
4. Validation runs (format ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí blacklist)
5. System shows result:
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmark if valid
   - ‚ùå Red X with error message if invalid
   - üí° Yellow warning with suggestion if typo detected
6. User can correct and revalidate immediately
```

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** JavaScript validation library + API calls
- **Backend:** Python email validation service
- **Database:** Validation results stored in `email_validations` table
- **Cache:** Redis for domain validation results

### Data Model
**New Table: `email_validations`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_validations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  is_valid BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  validation_method VARCHAR(50),  -- 'format', 'dns', 'disposable_check'
  failure_reason TEXT,
  validated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

**Update Table: `users`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_validated_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_validation_status VARCHAR(20);
```

### Security Requirements
- Rate limiting: 10 validation requests per minute per IP
- DNS queries use secure resolver (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1)
- No email addresses logged in application logs (GDPR/privacy)
- Disposable email blacklist stored securely

### Performance Requirements
- Validation response time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- DNS query timeout: 100ms max
- Cache hit rate: >80% for repeat domain validations
- Support 1000 concurrent validation requests

### Dependencies
- **email-validator** (Python) - RFC 5322 parsing
- **dnspython** - DNS MX record queries
- **Redis** - Caching layer
- **disposable-email-domains** - Blacklist library

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.11, Flask
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (no framework required)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+
- **Cache:** Redis 6+

## 8. Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Email bounce rate < 2%** (currently 15%)
2. **Validation response time < 200ms** (95th percentile)
3. **False rejection rate < 1%** (valid emails incorrectly rejected)
4. **User registration completion rate increases by 10%** (fewer form abandonment)

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **Support tickets related to email issues decrease by 50%**
2. **User satisfaction with registration process improves** (post-launch survey)

### Monitoring & Analytics
- **Track:** Validation success/failure rates by method (format/DNS/blacklist)
- **Alert:** If validation response time exceeds 500ms
- **Dashboard:** Real-time validation metrics in admin panel
- **Log:** All failed validations for review and improvement

## 9. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Email format validation with RFC 5322 test vectors
- DNS query mocking for various scenarios
- Disposable domain blacklist checking
- Code coverage target: 90%+

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end validation flow (format ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí blacklist)
- Database record creation and querying
- Cache behavior (hit/miss scenarios)
- API endpoint response validation

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test with real user email addresses
- Verify error messages are clear and helpful
- Test common typo suggestions
- Validate performance under realistic load

### Security Testing
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Input sanitization (XSS, injection attacks)
- GDPR compliance (no email logging)

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Q:** Should we block all disposable emails or allow with warning?
   - **Status:** Resolved - Block completely for now, add override in Phase 2
   - **Owner:** Product team

2. **Q:** What's the acceptable timeout for DNS queries?
   - **Status:** Resolved - 100ms timeout, fallback to format-only validation
   - **Owner:** Engineering team

## 11. Timeline & Milestones

- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Backend validation service + database schema
- **Phase 2 (Week 1-2):** Frontend integration + UI feedback
- **Phase 3 (Week 2):** Testing + performance optimization
- **Phase 4 (Week 3):** Deployment + monitoring

**Total Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks

## 12. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| DNS queries slow down validation | High | Medium | Implement aggressive caching, 100ms timeout, async validation |
| False positives block legitimate users | High | Low | Comprehensive testing, easy override mechanism, support monitoring |
| Disposable email blacklist becomes outdated | Medium | High | Automated weekly updates, admin UI for manual additions |
| International email addresses rejected | Medium | Low | Full RFC 5322 compliance testing, IDN support |

## 13. Assumptions

1. PostgreSQL database is configured and accessible
2. Redis cache server is available
3. Frontend can make async API calls
4. DNS resolution is available (not blocked by firewall)
5. Users have JavaScript enabled in browser
