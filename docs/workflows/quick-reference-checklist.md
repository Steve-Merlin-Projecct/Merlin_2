# Quick Reference Checklist for Agents
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 6, 2025

## üéØ Before Starting ANY Work

```
[ ] Is this a TASK or a QUESTION?
    ‚îî‚îÄ Task indicators: "Create", "Build", "Fix", "Implement", "Add"
    ‚îî‚îÄ Question indicators: "How", "What", "Why", "Can you explain"

    IF QUESTION ‚Üí Provide analysis only, ask if they want implementation
    IF TASK ‚Üí Proceed with 3-phase workflow below
```

---

## üìã PHASE 1: PRD Creation

```
[ ] Acknowledge: "I've detected this as a task request"
[ ] Create directory: /tasks/[feature-name]/
[ ] Ask clarifying questions (use lettered/numbered lists)
[ ] Wait for user responses
[ ] Generate PRD using template
[ ] Save to: /tasks/[feature-name]/prd.md
[ ] Ask: "Would you like me to proceed with Phase 2: Task Generation?"
[ ] Wait for approval
```

**PRD Must Include:**
- [ ] Overview (problem statement, solution, success criteria)
- [ ] Goals (specific, measurable)
- [ ] User Stories (with acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Functional Requirements (numbered: FR1, FR2, etc.)
- [ ] Non-Goals (scope boundaries)
- [ ] Technical Considerations (architecture, dependencies, security)
- [ ] Success Metrics (quantitative and qualitative)

---

## üìù PHASE 2: Task Generation

```
[ ] Announce: "Phase 2: Task Generation"
[ ] Read PRD from: /tasks/[feature-name]/prd.md
[ ] Create 4-7 parent tasks
[ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è  ALWAYS include Documentation parent task (REQUIRED)
[ ] Break each parent into 3-8 sub-tasks
[ ] Identify all relevant files (implementation + tests)
[ ] Create TodoWrite entries for all tasks (status: pending)
[ ] Save to: /tasks/[feature-name]/tasklist_1.md
[ ] Ask: "Would you like me to proceed with Phase 3: Task Execution?"
[ ] Wait for approval
```

**Standard Parent Tasks:**
1. Setup & Configuration
2. Core Implementation
3. User Interface (if applicable)
4. Integration (if applicable)
5. Testing
6. **Documentation (REQUIRED)**
7. Deployment & Validation (if applicable)

**Documentation Parent Task Must Include:**
- [ ] 5.1 Add inline documentation to all new files
- [ ] 5.2 Create component documentation in /docs/component_docs/[module]/
- [ ] 5.3 Document data flow and integration points
- [ ] 5.4 Add API documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] 5.5 Update related documentation
- [ ] 5.6 Archive outdated documentation
- [ ] 5.7 Update master changelog

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 3: Task Execution

### For Each Sub-Task:

```
[ ] Mark as in_progress in TodoWrite (ONLY ONE at a time)
[ ] Update markdown file (optional visual indicator)
[ ] Execute the work:
    [ ] Write code following project standards
    [ ] Add comprehensive inline documentation
    [ ] Implement error handling
[ ] Mark as completed in TodoWrite IMMEDIATELY
[ ] Update markdown file with [x]
[ ] Check: Are all sub-tasks in parent done?
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Move to next sub-task
    ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Proceed to Parent Task Completion below
```

### Section Completion (Use Automated Scripts):

**After 3+ tasks (Checkpoint):**
```
[ ] Stage changes: git add .
[ ] Run checkpoint script:
    ./scripts/checkpoint.sh "Section Name" "Completed tasks 1.1-1.3"
[ ] Script automatically: tests ‚Üí schema automation ‚Üí checkpoint commit
```

**After ALL tasks in section (Section Commit):**
```
[ ] Stage changes: git add .
[ ] Run section commit script:
    ./scripts/commit-section.sh "Section Name" "feat|fix|docs" "/tasks/feature/prd.md"

[ ] Script automatically handles:
    [ ] Runs full test suite (FAILS if tests fail)
    [ ] Runs database schema automation (if needed)
    [ ] Verifies documentation exists (FAILS if missing)
    [ ] Cleans up temporary files
    [ ] Generates conventional commit message
    [ ] Creates commit
    [ ] Updates version in CLAUDE.md
    [ ] Generates changelog template

[ ] Agent responds to script prompts:
    [ ] Confirm commit creation (y)
    [ ] Open changelog for editing (y)
    [ ] Update changelog with provided template

[ ] Mark section as completed in TodoWrite
[ ] Mark section as completed in markdown [x]

[ ] Move to next section
```

**Scripts are at:** `/workspace/.trees/task-guiding-docs/scripts/`

See [Automatic Checkpoints & Commits Guide](./automatic-checkpoints-commits.md)

---

## üîÑ TodoWrite Synchronization

**CRITICAL RULES:**
```
[ ] ONLY ONE task can be "in_progress" at a time
[ ] Update TodoWrite IMMEDIATELY when status changes (no batching)
[ ] Every TodoWrite entry needs:
    - content: "Imperative form" (e.g., "Create user model")
    - activeForm: "Present continuous" (e.g., "Creating user model")
    - status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"
```

**Sync with Markdown:**
```
When starting a task:
  TodoWrite: status = "in_progress"
  Markdown: - [‚Üí] or note "‚Üê Currently working"

When completing a task:
  TodoWrite: status = "completed"
  Markdown: - [x]
```

**If Out of Sync:**
```
[ ] Review markdown file to see actual state
[ ] Update TodoWrite to match reality
[ ] Going forward: update BOTH immediately, always
```

## üìö Documentation Checklist

### Inline Documentation (Every File):
```
[ ] File-level docstring (purpose, components, dependencies, related docs)
[ ] Class docstrings (purpose, attributes, usage example, related files)
[ ] Function docstrings:
    [ ] Description
    [ ] Args (type and description)
    [ ] Returns (type and description)
    [ ] Raises (exceptions)
    [ ] Examples
    [ ] Related functions
    [ ] Data processed
[ ] Inline comments for complex logic (explain "why", not "what")
```

### Component Documentation (New Features):
```
[ ] Create: /docs/component_docs/[module]/[feature].md
[ ] Include sections:
    [ ] Overview (purpose, key functionality)
    [ ] Architecture (dependencies, system context)
    [ ] Implementation Files (core files, tests, config)
    [ ] Data Flow (input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output)
    [ ] Database Interactions (tables, queries)
    [ ] API Endpoints (if applicable)
    [ ] Configuration (env vars, settings)
    [ ] Error Handling
    [ ] Security Considerations
    [ ] Performance
    [ ] Testing (coverage, running tests)
    [ ] Usage Examples
    [ ] Troubleshooting
    [ ] Related Documentation
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes

**ALWAYS use automation tools:**
```
[ ] Make schema changes to PostgreSQL database
[ ] Run: python database_tools/update_schema.py
[ ] Verify generated files updated:
    - frontend_templates/database_schema.html
    - docs/component_docs/database/*.md
    - database_tools/generated/*.py
[ ] Stage ALL generated files: git add .
[ ] Commit with schema changes

NEVER:
  ‚ùå Manually edit generated files
  ‚ùå Skip running automation
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

```
‚ùå Implementing code without creating PRD first
‚ùå Skipping task list generation
‚ùå Having multiple tasks "in_progress" in TodoWrite
‚ùå Batching TodoWrite updates instead of immediate
‚ùå Forgetting to include Documentation parent task
‚ùå Committing without running tests
‚ùå Not updating changelog after parent task
‚ùå Manually editing database schema documentation
‚ùå Forgetting to archive outdated documentation
‚ùå Not adding inline documentation to new code
‚ùå Skipping component documentation for new features
```

## üéì Questions to Ask Yourself

**Before starting work:**
- [ ] Is this a task or a question?
- [ ] Do I have a PRD?
- [ ] Do I have a task list with Documentation included?
- [ ] Is the user ready for me to start implementing?

**During work:**
- [ ] Do I have exactly ONE task in_progress in TodoWrite?
- [ ] Am I updating both TodoWrite and markdown immediately?
- [ ] Am I adding comprehensive inline documentation?
- [ ] Am I following the project's coding standards?

**Before committing:**
- [ ] Did all tests pass?
- [ ] Did I create/update component documentation?
- [ ] Did I archive any outdated documentation?
- [ ] Did I update the master changelog?
- [ ] Did I update the version number?
- [ ] Is my commit message in conventional format?

**After completing full feature:**
- [ ] Is all documentation complete and accurate?
- [ ] Are all tasks marked completed in TodoWrite?
- [ ] Is the changelog updated?
- [ ] Are all tests passing?
