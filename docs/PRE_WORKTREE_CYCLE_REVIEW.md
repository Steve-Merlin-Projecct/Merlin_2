# Pre-Worktree Cycle Review
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Branch:** feature/v4.5.1-development  
**Purpose:** Prepare for next worktree development cycle

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Librarian Phase 4: Automation & Enforcement
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Deliverables:**
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
  - Validates only staged .md files (lightweight, <1 second)
  - Checks YAML frontmatter presence
  - Prevents root directory violations
  - Bypassable with `--no-verify` flag
  - Install script: `tools/install_hooks.sh`

- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/librarian-checks.yml`)
  - Validates documentation on PRs
  - Checks: metadata, file organization, broken links
  - Auto-updates documentation index on merge to main/develop/feature branches
  - Blocks PRs with validation failures

**Note:** No optional enhancements added per user request

### 2. Librarian Phase 5: Cleanup & Rollout
**Status:** ✅ Complete (previously)

**Results:**
- 100% metadata coverage (704 documents)
- Root directory violations: 77 → 0
- Catalog rebuilt with 704 indexed documents

### 3. Database Unification
**Status:** ✅ No Action Needed

**Finding:** The database table consolidation PRD (`docs/archived/database/prd-database-table-consolidation.md`) is marked as `archived` and appears to be a past consideration, not current work.

**Recommendation:** No database unification work required at this time.

### 4. Recent Worktrees Review
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Findings:**

#### Incomplete Worktree (Auto-staged for Next Cycle)
- **Task:** Resume and cover letter content improvements
- **Status:** Marked incomplete, 0 commits, 0 files changed
- **Action:** Will automatically stage in next `/tree closedone --full-cycle`

#### Recent Completed Work (Last 7 Days)
- Librarian system (Phases 4-5)
- Security improvements (password hashing, rate limiting, API key removal)
- Production database configuration
- Work estimation policy (token-based estimates)
- Worktree improvements

## ⚠️ Pending Work (User Action Required)

### Production Database Migrations
**File:** `tasks/PENDING-production-migration-deployment.md`  
**Priority:** High  
**Action Required:** Manual deployment

**Outstanding Migrations:**
1. `database_tools/migrations/001_create_security_detections_table.sql`
2. `database_tools/migrations/002_create_job_analysis_tiers_table.sql`

**Why Pending:**
- Requires IP whitelisting on Digital Ocean database firewall
- Requires production database credentials
- Cannot be automated without production access

**Deployment Options:**
1. **Automated:** `python database_tools/verify_production_migrations.py --apply-to-production`
2. **Manual:** Run SQL files via psql
3. **Console:** Copy/paste into Digital Ocean database console

**Impact if Not Deployed:**
- Tiered analysis system will fail with "table does not exist" errors
- Security detection logging will fail
- Production application errors

**Verification:**
```bash
python database_tools/verify_production_migrations.py
# Should show: "✓ READY TO MERGE - Production is up to date"
```

## 🔍 System Status

### Git State
- **Branch:** feature/v4.5.1-development
- **Status:** Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Recent commits:** 3 (Phase 4, Phase 5 report, Phase 5 implementation)

### Documentation System
- **Total docs:** 704
- **Metadata coverage:** 100%
- **Root violations:** 0
- **Catalog:** Up to date (704 indexed)
- **Validation:** Pre-commit hook active
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow ready

### Active Worktrees
- **Main workspace:** /workspace
- **Incomplete worktrees:** 1 (resume/cover letter - will auto-stage)
- **Completed worktrees:** All merged and archived

## 📋 Recommendations for Next Worktree Cycle

### Before Building Worktrees

1. **Deploy Production Migrations** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   python database_tools/verify_production_migrations.py --apply-to-production
   ```

2. **Verify Pre-commit Hook Installed** (for new contributors)
   ```bash
   bash tools/install_hooks.sh
   ```

3. **Check System Health**
   ```bash
   python tools/collect_metrics.py
   python tools/validate_metadata.py --all
   python tools/validate_location.py --scan-root
   ```

### During Worktree Development

1. **Documentation Validation:** Pre-commit hook will automatically validate .md files
2. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions will validate on PRs
3. **Catalog Updates:** Automatically update on merge to main/develop/feature branches

### Incomplete Work to Continue

- Resume and cover letter content improvements (auto-staged)

---

## 🎯 Ready for Next Cycle

**Unified branch work:** ✅ Complete  
**Documentation system:** ✅ Operational  
**Validation enforcement:** ✅ Active  
**Production migrations:** ⚠️ User action required  

**Next Step:** 
```bash
/tree stage <feature-description>
/tree build
```

Or use full-cycle automation:
```bash
/tree closedone --full-cycle
```
