# Tasks: Copywriting Evaluator System Implementation

Based on Product Requirements Document: `prd-copywriting-evaluator.md`

## Current Status Assessment

âœ… **Database Schema: COMPLETE** - All required schema changes have been applied:
- Both sentence bank tables have multi-stage tracking columns (17 new columns each)
- New support tables exist: keyword_filters, canadian_spellings, performance_metrics
- Column renames completed (stage â†’ status)

ðŸ”§ **Next Phase: Core Implementation** - Need to build processing modules and dashboard integration

- `tests/test_variable_features.py` - Test suite for variable validation, repetition prevention, and substitution

### Notes

- Follow existing Flask application patterns and integrate with current dashboard design
- Reuse existing Gemini API client, database connections, and CSV processing utilities
- Database changes are complete - focus on business logic implementation and variable feature integration
- All processing stages must support restart capability and independent status tracking
- Variable feature requires two separate systems: `{job_title}` variables and existing `<<template>>` variables
- Content selection algorithm modified to prevent variable repetition in cover letters
- Pipeline processing must validate and reject sentences with unsupported variables (anything other than `{job_title}` and `{company_name}`)
