**Current Version:** 1.0.0 (MVP)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
**Planning Horizon:** 6-12 months

---

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic development plan for the Application Automation Module following the successful MVP deployment. The roadmap is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous to expand platform support, enhance automation capabilities, and improve user experience.

---

## Phase 1: MVP Stabilization & Refinement (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Ensure MVP is stable and production-ready

### 1.1 Real-World Testing & Refinement
**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test with 20+ real Indeed job applications
- [ ] Identify and fix edge cases in form detection
- [ ] Refine form selectors based on failures
- [ ] Optimize screenshot capture quality/size
- [ ] Tune retry logic and timeout values

**Success Metrics:**
- Success rate >80%
- Error rate <15%
- Average completion time <90s
- Zero critical bugs

### 1.2 Monitoring & Observability
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 1 week

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging in Actor
- [ ] Add metrics collection (success rate, timing, errors)
- [ ] Create dashboard for monitoring (Apify + Flask)
- [ ] Set up alerts for failures (email/Slack)
- [ ] Document troubleshooting runbooks

**Deliverables:**
- Monitoring dashboard
- Alert configuration
- Incident response guide

### 1.3 Form Mapping Updates
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Ongoing

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Monitor Indeed site for changes
- [ ] Create automated selector validation tests
- [ ] Build selector update workflow
- [ ] Document selector maintenance process

**Note:** Indeed updates HTML frequently. Plan for monthly selector reviews.

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Indeed Support (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Improve Indeed automation reliability and coverage

### 2.1 Multi-Page Form Support
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 2 weeks

**Current Limitation:** MVP only handles single-page forms
**Solution:** Implement multi-step form navigation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Detect multi-page forms
- [ ] Implement "Next" button navigation
- [ ] Handle form validation errors between pages
- [ ] Save progress at each step (checkpointing)
- [ ] Test with 10+ multi-page Indeed applications

**Technical Approach:**
```python
async def fill_multipage_form(page, form_data):
    """
    Handle multi-page form with navigation and checkpointing
    """
    pages_completed = []
    current_page = 1

    while True:
        # Fill current page
        await fill_page_fields(page, form_data, current_page)
        pages_completed.append(current_page)

        # Check for next button
        next_button = await detect_next_button(page)
        if not next_button:
            break  # Last page, proceed to submit

        # Navigate to next page
        await next_button.click()
        await page.wait_for_load_state()
        current_page += 1

    return pages_completed
```

### 2.2 Custom Screening Questions
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 2 weeks

**Current Limitation:** Generic handling of custom questions
**Solution:** Intelligent question answering with AI

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Catalog common Indeed screening questions
- [ ] Create answer templates for common questions
- [ ] Implement GPT-4 integration for custom questions
- [ ] Add user-configurable default answers
- [ ] Test with 20+ applications with screening questions

**Question Types to Handle:**
- Work authorization (Yes/No)
- Salary expectations (Numerical with validation)
- Years of experience (Numerical)
- Willingness to relocate (Yes/No)
- Start date availability (Date picker)
- Cover letter requirement (Text area)

**Technical Approach:**
```python
async def answer_screening_questions(page, questions, user_profile):
    """
    Answer screening questions intelligently
    """
    for question in questions:
        question_text = await extract_question_text(question)

        # Try template match first
        answer = match_template_answer(question_text, user_profile)

        # Fall back to AI if no template match
        if not answer:
            answer = await ask_gpt4(question_text, user_profile)

        await fill_question(question, answer)
```

### 2.3 Pre-Submit Confirmation Workflow
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 1 week

**Current Limitation:** Auto-submit without pre-review
**Solution:** Optional pre-submit confirmation via web UI

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add "confirmation mode" flag to Actor input
- [ ] Implement Actor pause before submit
- [ ] Create Flask endpoint for approval/rejection
- [ ] Build simple web UI for review
- [ ] Test confirmation workflow end-to-end

**User Flow:**
1. Actor fills form
2. Captures screenshot
3. Pauses and sends webhook to Flask
4. User reviews in web UI
5. User approves/rejects
6. Actor resumes and submits (or aborts)

---

## Phase 3: Hybrid Detection System (Weeks 9-12)

**Goal:** Implement AI-powered fallback for unknown forms

**Priority:** High (Critical for platform expansion)
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

### 3.1 AI-Powered Field Detection
**Technology:** GPT-4 Vision API or Google Gemini Vision

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research and select AI vision provider
- [ ] Implement screenshot-based field detection
- [ ] Create prompt engineering for form analysis
- [ ] Build field-to-selector mapping
- [ ] Test accuracy on 50+ unknown forms

**Technical Architecture:**
```python
class HybridFormDetector:
    """
    Hybrid approach: Pre-mapped selectors + AI fallback
    """

    async def detect_form_fields(self, page, url):
        # Try pre-mapped first (fast, reliable)
        platform = self.detect_platform(url)
        if platform and platform in self.mappings:
            selectors = self.mappings[platform]
            if await self.validate_selectors(page, selectors):
                return {"method": "pre_mapped", "selectors": selectors}

        # Fall back to AI detection (slower, flexible)
        screenshot = await page.screenshot()
        ai_selectors = await self.ai_detector.detect_fields(screenshot)

        # Cache successful AI detections for future use
        if ai_selectors:
            await self.cache_selectors(url, ai_selectors)

        return {"method": "ai_detected", "selectors": ai_selectors}
```

**Cost Considerations:**
- GPT-4 Vision: ~$0.01-0.05 per image
- Google Gemini: ~$0.001-0.01 per image
- Budget: $50-100/month for 1000 applications with 50% AI usage

### 3.2 Dynamic Selector Learning
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 2 weeks

**Concept:** Learn from successful applications to improve selector library

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Log successful selectors used
- [ ] Implement selector confidence scoring
- [ ] Build selector suggestion system
- [ ] Create admin UI for reviewing/approving new selectors
- [ ] Add automated selector testing

**Technical Approach:**
```python
class SelectorLearningSystem:
    """
    Learn optimal selectors from successful applications
    """

    def record_success(self, url, selectors_used, fields_filled):
        """Record which selectors worked"""
        for field, selector in selectors_used.items():
            self.success_db.increment_score(url, field, selector)

    def suggest_selectors(self, url, field):
        """Suggest best selectors based on historical success"""
        return self.success_db.get_top_selectors(url, field, limit=5)

    def auto_update_mappings(self):
        """Automatically update mappings when confidence threshold met"""
        for platform in self.platforms:
            for field in self.fields:
                best_selector = self.success_db.get_best(platform, field)
                if best_selector.confidence > 0.9:
                    self.update_mapping(platform, field, best_selector)
```

        """
        Handle Workday's multi-step wizard
        """
        steps = await self.detect_workday_steps(page)

        for step in steps:
            # Wait for dynamic content to load
            await self.wait_for_workday_ready(page)

            # Fill current step
            await self.fill_step_fields(page, step, application_data)

            # Handle step-specific logic
