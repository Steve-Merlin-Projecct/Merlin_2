## Known Issues

### Resolved âœ…
- API signature mismatches in resilience modules
- Import errors in test files
- Missing resilience module components

### Outstanding
1. **TimeoutManager Threading (8 tests)**
   - Signal-based timeouts don't work in threads
   - Requires refactoring to use threading.Timer
   - Not blocking, can be addressed later

2. **Integration Test Failures (21 tests)**
   - Sequential batch workflow: 19 failures (time-dependent, database state)
   - Calendly workflow: 1 failure (link tracking)
   - Requires mocking time, fixing database setup

3. **Zero-Coverage Modules (24 modules)**
   - Email system (1,416 lines)
   - Workflow orchestration (771 lines)
   - Dashboard APIs (261 lines)
   - And 21 more modules
