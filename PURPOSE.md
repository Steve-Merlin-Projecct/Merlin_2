# Purpose: create a worktree improvements branch with all the

**Worktree:** create-a-worktree-improvements-branch-with-all-the
**Branch:** task/01-create-a-worktree-improvements-branch-with-all-the
**Base Branch:** develop/v4.3.1-worktrees-20251010-050425
**Created:** 2025-10-10 05:04:27

## Objective

create a worktree improvements branch with all the learnigns from the attemp just made to build the trees

## Scope

### Verified Functionality
The `/tree` command has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ `/tree stage [description]` - Stages features for worktree creation
- ✅ `/tree list` - Lists all staged features
- ✅ `/tree build` - Creates worktrees with confirmation prompt
- ✅ `/tree status` - Shows comprehensive worktree environment status
- ✅ Git lock detection with 5-attempt retry mechanism
- ✅ Atomic worktree creation with proper branch naming (task/##-description)
- ✅ Build history tracking in `.trees/.build-history/`

### Test Results from 2025-10-10
**Test Case:** Created worktree "worktree-improvements"
- Successfully staged feature
- Build completed with confirmation
- Worktree created at: `/workspace/.trees/worktree-improvements`
- Branch created: `task/01-worktree-improvements`
- Development branch: `develop/v4.3.1-worktrees-20251010-051716`

### Known Issues
1. **Slash Command Recognition:** The `/tree` command exists at `.claude/commands/tree.md` with proper frontmatter, but Claude Code CLI doesn't recognize it. Workaround: Run directly with `bash /workspace/.claude/scripts/tree.sh`

### Scope for Improvement
- [ ] Debug slash command registration issue
- [ ] Document worktree workflow in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Add examples to `.claude/WORKTREE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Consider adding `/tree conflict` and `/tree closedone` functionality testing
- [ ] Integration with git-orchestrator for automated commits

## Out of Scope

- Major refactoring of tree.sh script (already functional)
- Alternative worktree management tools
- Changes to core git workflow

## Success Criteria

- [x] `/tree` functionality verified and working
- [x] Git lock handling tested
- [x] Atomic worktree creation confirmed
- [ ] Slash command recognition fixed
- [ ] Documentation updated in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Workflow examples added
- [ ] Integration with git-orchestrator tested
- [ ] Ready to merge

## Notes

### Implementation Details
- Script location: `/workspace/.claude/scripts/tree.sh`
- Config: `/workspace/.claude/worktree-config.json`
- Template: `/workspace/.claude/worktree-template.md`
- Worktrees created in: `/workspace/.trees/`

### Git Lock Handling
The script implements robust git lock detection:
```bash
# Waits up to 5 attempts with delays
# Then prompts user to manually remove: rm /workspace/.git/index.lock
```

### Branch Naming Convention
- Development branch: `develop/v4.3.1-worktrees-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Task branches: `task/##-sanitized-description`

### Next Steps
1. Investigate why Claude Code CLI doesn't load `.claude/commands/tree.md`
2. Test remaining commands: `/tree conflict`, `/tree close`, `/tree closedone`
3. Document complete workflow in CLAUDE.md Git Operations Policy section
4. Create integration tests with git-orchestrator
