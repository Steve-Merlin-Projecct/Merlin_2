### Verified Functionality
The `/tree` command has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ `/tree stage [description]` - Stages features for worktree creation
- ✅ `/tree list` - Lists all staged features
- ✅ `/tree build` - Creates worktrees with confirmation prompt
- ✅ `/tree status` - Shows comprehensive worktree environment status
- ✅ Git lock detection with 5-attempt retry mechanism
- ✅ Atomic worktree creation with proper branch naming (task/##-description)
- ✅ Build history tracking in `.trees/.build-history/`

### Test Results from 2025-10-10
**Test Case:** Created worktree "worktree-improvements"
- Successfully staged feature
- Build completed with confirmation
- Worktree created at: `/workspace/.trees/worktree-improvements`
- Branch created: `task/01-worktree-improvements`
- Development branch: `develop/v4.3.1-worktrees-20251010-051716`

## Conflict Warnings
- None - this is a standalone tooling worktree

### Known Issues
1. **Slash Command Recognition:** The `/tree` command exists at `.claude/commands/tree.md` with proper frontmatter, but Claude Code CLI doesn't recognize it. Workaround: Run directly with `bash /workspace/.claude/scripts/tree.sh`

✅ **Template Engine Integration** (`template_engine.py`)
- Automatic security scanning on document generation
- Fail-safe: deletes unsafe documents
- SecurityError exception for blocked documents

✅ **Comprehensive Testing** (`test_docx_security_scanner.py`)
- 23 test cases covering all security features
- Unit tests for scanner and logger
- Integration tests for complete workflow
- 100% test pass rate

✅ **Documentation** (`docs/security/docx-security-verification.md`)
- Complete usage guide
- Threat protection details
- Configuration and best practices
- Compliance and incident response

## Out of Scope

- Macro execution detection (DOCX cannot contain VBA macros natively)
- Content-based antivirus scanning
- Deep OLE stream parsing (basic detection implemented)
- Template library scanning (templates are generated in-house)

## Success Criteria

- [x] `/tree` functionality verified and working
- [x] Git lock handling tested
- [x] Atomic worktree creation confirmed
- [ ] Slash command recognition fixed
- [ ] Documentation updated in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Workflow examples added
- [ ] Integration with git-orchestrator tested
- [ ] Ready to merge
||||||| Stash base
## Status
- [x] Planning
- [x] Development
- [x] Testing
- [ ] Ready for merge

[Define what's explicitly NOT in scope]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All functionality implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Ready to merge

## Notes

### Security Philosophy

This implementation follows a **defensive security** approach:
- **Detection only:** Identifies threats, does not create or modify malicious content
- **Fail-safe:** Blocks documents when in doubt
- **Audit trail:** Complete logging for forensic analysis
- **Best practices:** Follows OWASP guidelines for document security

### Compliance Support

### Next Steps
1. Investigate why Claude Code CLI doesn't load `.claude/commands/tree.md`
2. Test remaining commands: `/tree conflict`, `/tree close`, `/tree closedone`
3. Document complete workflow in CLAUDE.md Git Operations Policy section
4. Create integration tests with git-orchestrator

This worktree contains all tools for managing the parallel development workflow across 13+ task worktrees.
