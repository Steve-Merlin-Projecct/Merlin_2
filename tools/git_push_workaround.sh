echo "1. Open the Shell tab in Replit"
echo ""
echo "2. Run these commands manually:"
echo "   git add ."
echo "   git commit -m 'Your commit message'"

echo "4. Alternative: Use Replit's built-in Git panel"
echo "   - Click the Git icon in the sidebar"
echo "   - Stage your changes"
echo "   - Commit with a message"
echo "   - Push to origin"
