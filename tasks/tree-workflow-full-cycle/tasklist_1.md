# Tree Workflow Full-Cycle Automation

**PRD:** tasks/tree-workflow-full-cycle/prd.md

## Overview
Complete implementation of full-cycle worktree automation with intelligent feature management and Claude Code integration.

## Feature Staging Phase
- [x] Implement `/tree stage` with conflict detection
- [x] Create `/tree list` command to show staged features
- [x] Develop `/tree conflict` with similarity analysis
- [x] Add staging file persistence

## Worktree Creation Phase
- [x] Develop `/tree build` with intelligent worktree generation
- [x] Create context files (PURPOSE.md, .claude-task-context.md)
- [x] Implement future work loading mechanism
- [x] Auto-launch Claude with task-specific context

## Development Workflow
- [x] Create `/tree close` command for work completion
- [x] Implement automatic change commit
- [x] Develop future work capture system
- [x] Generate comprehensive work synopsis

## Merge and Cleanup
- [x] Implement `/tree closedone` for batch merge
- [x] Create conflict resolution strategy
- [x] Develop worktree cleanup mechanism
- [x] Archive completed worktree information

## Environment Management
- [x] Create `/tree status` for tracking worktrees
- [x] Develop `/tree restore` for terminal session recovery
- [x] Implement `/tree refresh` for slash command diagnostics

## Testing and Validation
- [x] Comprehensive script testing
- [x] Edge case handling
- [x] Error recovery mechanisms
- [x] Documentation and help system

## Documentation
- [x] Update .claude/commands/tree.md
- [x] Write comprehensive help text
- [x] Create inline documentation
- [x] Document workflow in script comments

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements
- [ ] Explore advanced conflict resolution
- [ ] Add more granular configuration options
- [ ] Develop cloud synchronization prototype

## Final Validation
- [x] End-to-end workflow testing
- [x] Performance benchmarking
- [x] User experience review
