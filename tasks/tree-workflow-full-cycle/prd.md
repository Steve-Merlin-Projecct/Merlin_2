# Full-Cycle Worktree Automation

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive, intelligent worktree management system that automates the entire development lifecycle from feature staging to completion and batch merging.

## Key Features
- Intelligent feature staging with conflict detection
- Automatic worktree creation with context preservation
- Full-cycle workflow automation
- Future work capture and continuity
- Seamless Claude Code integration

## Phases of Automation

### 1. Feature Staging
- Stage multiple features with descriptive names
- Perform automatic conflict and similarity analysis
- Generate unique, predictable branch names

### 2. Worktree Creation
- Create isolated worktrees for each staged feature
- Automatically load previous related work
- Generate context files with task details
- Auto-launch Claude with task-specific context

### 3. Development Workflow
- Provide slash commands for worktree management
- Capture work in progress
- Handle uncommitted changes
- Generate comprehensive work synopses

### 4. Completion and Merge
- Automatically commit changes
- Capture future work and incomplete tasks
- Generate detailed synopsis
- Batch merge completed worktrees
- Handle conflict resolution

### 5. Environment Management
- Track active and completed worktrees
- Restore terminal sessions
- Provide session refresh mechanisms

### 6. Continuous Improvement
- Capture technical debt
- Enable work continuity across iterations
- Support manual intervention when needed

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All phases of worktree lifecycle fully automated
- [ ] Minimal manual intervention required
- [ ] Work context preserved between iterations
- [ ] Conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and tracking
- [ ] Claude Code seamlessly integrated

## Out of Scope
- Manual merge conflict resolution
- Cloud-based worktree synchronization
- Advanced git operations beyond merge
