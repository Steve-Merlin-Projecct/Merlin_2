# v4.2.0 Development Plan - Executive Summary

**Version:** 4.2.0
**Created:** October 8, 2025
**Estimated Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Total Features:** 7 (from 13 tasks)

## Quick Start

### 1. Read Planning Documents
1. **[dependency-analysis.md](dependency-analysis.md)** - Understand task relationships
2. **[feature-branch-strategy.md](feature-branch-strategy.md)** - Feature definitions and worktree setup
3. **[conflict-avoidance-strategy.md](conflict-avoidance-strategy.md)** - How to avoid and resolve conflicts

### 2. Set Up Worktrees

```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation (Start Here!)
git worktree add .trees/claude-tools -b feature/claude-dev-tools origin/main

# Phase 2: Content & Templates (After Phase 1)
git worktree add .trees/content-ai -b feature/content-ai-system origin/main
git worktree add .trees/templates -b feature/template-verification origin/main

# Phase 3: Delivery (After Phase 2)
git worktree add .trees/calendly -b feature/calendly-integration origin/main
git worktree add .trees/email -b feature/email-system-v2 origin/main

# Phase 4: Monitoring (After Phase 3)
git worktree add .trees/dashboard -b feature/dashboard-analytics origin/main

# Ongoing: Testing (Parallel)
git worktree add .trees/testing -b feature/testing-system origin/main
```

### 3. Create API Contracts (Before Coding!)

```bash
mkdir -p docs/api-contracts/v4.2.0
cd docs/api-contracts/v4.2.0

# Create these contracts:
touch template-variables.yaml
touch application-package.json
touch analytics-events.yaml
touch ui-components.md
```

## Conflict Hotspots & Solutions

### 🔥 Critical Conflicts

**1. CLAUDE.md** (Features 1 + 10)
- **Solution:** Feature 1 owns CLAUDE.md, Librarian creates separate action plan doc

**2. Frontend Templates** (Dashboard redesign)
- **Solution:** Create new template files, component isolation

**3. Application Package** (Calendly + Email)
- **Solution:** Define package structure in API contract first

**4. Template Variables** (Content AI + Templates)
- **Solution:** Templates publishes schema, Content AI implements to it

### ⚠️ Moderate Conflicts

**5. Gemini Prompts** (Content AI + Prompt Security)
- **Solution:** Combined into single feature (Feature 2)

**6. Dashboard Components** (Dashboard + DB Viz + Analytics)
- **Solution:** Combined into single feature (Feature 6) OR strict component isolation

## Merge Sequence (MUST FOLLOW!)

```
1. feature/claude-dev-tools         → main (FIRST)

2. feature/content-ai-system         → main (SECOND)
   feature/template-verification     → main (SECOND)

3. feature/calendly-integration      → main (THIRD)
   feature/email-system-v2          → main (THIRD)

4. feature/dashboard-analytics       → main (LAST)

5. feature/testing-system            → main (ANYTIME)
```

**Why This Order?**
1. Foundation tools enable other work
2. Content & templates can parallel (with API contract)
3. Delivery systems coordinate through API contract
4. Dashboard needs data from earlier features
5. Testing supports all, no dependencies

## Daily Workflow

### Morning (15 min)
1. Check `/tasks/v4.2.0-planning/daily-status.md`
2. Update your feature's status
3. Note any blockers or file conflicts

### During Development
1. Stick to file ownership matrix
2. Coordinate before modifying shared files
3. Update API contracts when designs change
4. Commit early, commit often

### Before PR
1. Run integration test: `scripts/integration-test.sh`
2. Check for conflicts with other PRs
3. Ensure tests pass
4. Request code review

### After Merge
1. Notify other features of changes
2. Update API contracts if needed
3. Monitor main branch health

## Risk Mitigation

### Prevention
- ✅ Define API contracts before coding
- ✅ Use file ownership matrix
- ✅ Install pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Follow merge sequence

### Detection
- ✅ Daily status updates
- ✅ Automated conflict alerts
- ✅ Integration testing

### Resolution
- ✅ Feature owner resolves conflicts
- ✅ Document decisions in API contract
- ✅ Rollback if main breaks

## Success Metrics

**v4.2.0 Complete When:**
- ✅ All 7 features merged to main
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Production ready
