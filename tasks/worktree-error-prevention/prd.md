# Product Requirements Document: Worktree Error Prevention System

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive error prevention and recovery system for git worktree operations to ensure data integrity and build reliability.

## Key Requirements
- Prevent accidental data loss during worktree operations
- Implement pre-flight validation checks
- Provide automatic cleanup of orphaned worktrees
- Detect and remove stale git locks
- Support atomic build failure rollback
- Enhance error reporting and verbosity

## Functional Specifications
1. Validate Cleanup Safety
   - Implement checks to prevent unintended data destruction
   - Verify no uncommitted changes before cleanup
   - Protect critical branches and active worktrees

2. Worktree Path Validation
   - Pre-flight validation of worktree creation paths
   - Check for existing directories
   - Validate naming conventions
   - Prevent duplicate or conflicting worktree names

3. Orphaned Worktree Cleanup
   - Automated detection of orphaned worktrees
   - Safe removal of abandoned branches
   - Batch cleanup mechanisms
   - Configurable retention policies

4. Git Lock Management
   - Detect stale git locks
   - Automatically remove locks older than 60 seconds
   - Zero-byte lock detection
   - Prevent stuck operations

5. Build Failure Recovery
   - Implement atomic rollback mechanisms
   - Preserve original state on build failure
   - Idempotent retry capabilities
   - Detailed error logging

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Minimal performance overhead
- High reliability
- Clear, informative error messages
- Compatibility with existing git workflows
- Optional verbose mode for debugging

## Success Criteria
- 99.9% data integrity preservation
- Automatic recovery from common git worktree errors
- Zero manual intervention required
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting
