# Worktree Error Prevention System Implementation Summary

## Core Functions Implemented
- `validate_cleanup_safe()`: Prevents data loss by checking uncommitted changes
- `validate_and_cleanup_worktree_path()`: Pre-flight path validation
- `cleanup_orphaned_worktrees()`: Batch worktree cleanup
- `check_git_locks()`: Stale lock detection and removal
- `rollback_build()`: Atomic failure recovery mechanism
- `safe_git()`: Enhanced error capture with verbose mode

## Key Implementation Details
- Atomic operations with rollback support
- Comprehensive error checking
- Configurable verbosity
- Safe, idempotent design

## Error Prevention Matrix
- Orphaned directories: Auto-removed
- Orphaned branches: Safely cleaned
- Stale locks: Automatically cleared
- Partial builds: Atomic rollback
- Build retries: Guaranteed success

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal overhead
- Quick validation checks
- Efficient cleanup algorithms

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced logging
- More granular retention policies
- Machine learning-based prediction of problematic worktrees
