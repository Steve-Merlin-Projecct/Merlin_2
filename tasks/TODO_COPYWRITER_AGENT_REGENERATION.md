# TODO: Regenerate Seed Sentences Using Copywriter Agent

**Date Created:** 2025-10-11
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Pending

---

## Issue Identified

The 777 seed sentences currently in the system were generated primarily by the general-purpose agent, with only ~20 sentences generated by the specialized `/copywriter` agent.


**Files Affected:**
- `user_content/COVER_LETTER_SENTENCES.txt` (189 sentences)
- `user_content/RESUME_SENTENCES.txt` (588 sentences)
- `user_content/FACTUAL_STATEMENTS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.txt` (300+ atomic facts)

---

## Why This Matters

The `/copywriter` agent at `.claude/commands/copywriter.md` was specifically designed and configured for professional writing with:
- Specialized prompts for job application materials
- Experimental voice and tone calibration
- Professional copywriting expertise
- Access to source materials and user profile

**Philosophy on Seed Sentence Generation:**
The seed sentences are intentionally experimental and varied - the goal is NOT to have a consistent brand voice at this stage. The goal is to create diverse, high-quality content that allows the variation phase to experiment more widely. Consistency and appropriateness emerge through the rigorous filtering phases:
1. Gemini variation generation (creates 7 variations per seed)
2. Truthfulness evaluation (validates factual accuracy)
3. Keyword selection phase (filters for job-specific relevance)
4. Tone analysis phase (matches tone to context)

This wide-funnel-to-narrow-filter approach ensures the right sentence is available at the right time for the right context.

## Recommended Action

**Option 1: Full Regeneration (Highest Quality)**
1. Use `/copywriter` agent to regenerate all 777 seed sentences
2. Apply same three-round approach:
   - Round 1: Professional accuracy, Canadian spelling, varied tone
   - Round 2: Compensation-optimized, executive positioning
   - Round 3: Recruiter-optimized, hook+payoff structure
3. Maintain inline employer tags throughout






**Notes:**
- Current sentences are backed up in `*_BACKUP.txt` files
- All sentences maintain Canadian spelling
- Factual accuracy validated against source materials
- Inline employer tags format: `[Odvod Media/Edify]`, `[Previous Employment]`, `[General]`, `[University of Alberta]`
