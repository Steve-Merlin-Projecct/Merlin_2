# TODO: Regenerate Seed Sentences Using Copywriter Agent

**Date Created:** 2025-10-11
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Pending

---

## Issue Identified

The 777 seed sentences currently in the system were generated primarily by the general-purpose agent, with only ~20 sentences generated by the specialized `/copywriter` agent.

**Current Sentence Distribution:**
- **Round 1:** 90 sentences (only ~20 used copywriter agent)
- **Round 2:** 200 compensation-optimized sentences (no copywriter agent)
- **Round 3:** 200 recruiter-optimized sentences (no copywriter agent)
- **Total:** ~757 sentences generated WITHOUT the copywriter agent

**Files Affected:**
- `user_content/COVER_LETTER_SENTENCES.txt` (189 sentences)
- `user_content/RESUME_SENTENCES.txt` (588 sentences)
- `user_content/FACTUAL_STATEMENTS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.txt` (300+ atomic facts)

---

## Why This Matters

The `/copywriter` agent at `.claude/commands/copywriter.md` was specifically designed and configured for professional writing with:
- Specialized prompts for job application materials
- Consistent voice and tone calibration
- Professional copywriting expertise
- Access to source materials and user profile

**Consistency Risk:** Sentences generated by different agents may have:
- Varying voice/tone patterns
- Different structural approaches
- Inconsistent professional positioning
- Mixed quality levels

---

## Recommended Action

**Option 1: Full Regeneration (Highest Quality)**
1. Use `/copywriter` agent to regenerate all 777 seed sentences
2. Apply same three-round approach:
   - Round 1: Professional accuracy, Canadian spelling, varied tone
   - Round 2: Compensation-optimized, executive positioning
   - Round 3: Recruiter-optimized, hook+payoff structure
3. Maintain inline employer tags throughout
4. Compare quality against current sentences
5. Replace if quality improvement is significant

**Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Pragmatic)**
1. Keep existing 777 sentences as "Batch A"
2. Generate 777 new sentences using `/copywriter` as "Batch B"
3. Run both through Gemini variation generation
4. Use evaluation pipeline to compare quality
5. Keep highest-scoring sentences from either batch

**Option 3: Supplement Only (Conservative)**
1. Keep existing 777 sentences
2. Generate additional 200-300 sentences using `/copywriter`
3. Expand total pool to ~1000 sentences
4. Provide more variety for variation generation

## Implementation Considerations

**Pros of Regeneration:**
- Consistent voice across all sentences
- Proper use of specialized agent as intended
- Higher quality professional writing
- Aligned with original system design

**Cons of Regeneration:**
- Time investment to regenerate 777 sentences
- Risk of losing good sentences from current batch
- Need to reapply inline employer tags
- May not show significant quality difference

**Current Status:**
- All 777 existing sentences have inline employer tags
- Source of truth file (300+ atomic facts) is complete
- Ready for Gemini API variation generation
- Evaluation pipeline exists but not executed

---

## Decision Factors

1. **Quality Gap:** How much better are copywriter-generated sentences?
2. **Timeline:** Is there urgency to begin variation generation?
3. **Risk Tolerance:** Acceptable to proceed with mixed-origin sentences?
4. **Resource Availability:** Time to regenerate vs. moving forward

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review copywriter agent configuration at `.claude/commands/copywriter.md`
- [ ] Generate 50-100 sample sentences using copywriter agent
- [ ] Compare sample quality against existing sentences
- [ ] Decide on Option 1, 2, or 3 based on quality assessment
- [ ] Document decision and rationale
- [ ] Execute chosen approach
- [ ] Update SENTENCE_GENERATION_SUMMARY.md with final methodology

---

**Notes:**
- Current sentences are backed up in `*_BACKUP.txt` files
- All sentences maintain Canadian spelling
- Factual accuracy validated against source materials
- Inline employer tags format: `[Odvod Media/Edify]`, `[Previous Employment]`, `[General]`, `[University of Alberta]`
