# Future Agent Ideas

Collection of potential specialized agents to enhance the Claude Code workflow.

## 1. GitTree Merge Agent

**Purpose:** Automate and streamline the git worktree merging process.

**Capabilities:**
- Automatically detect unmerged branches across all worktrees
- Intelligent merge conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- Sequential or parallel merge execution with rollback support
- Integration with existing `/worktree_tools/` scripts
- Pre-merge validation (tests, linting, builds)
- Post-merge cleanup (delete merged branches, prune worktrees)
- Generate merge reports and changelogs

**Use Cases:**
- End-of-sprint branch consolidation
- Feature branch integration
- Automated cleanup of completed work
- Conflict resolution assistance

**Integration Points:**
- Leverage `worktree_status.sh` and `merge_worktrees.sh`
- Hook into CI/CD pipeline
- Connect with GitHub PR workflow

## 2. File Organization Agent (Librarian Agent)

**Purpose:** Maintain project file structure, organization, and cleanup.

**Capabilities:**
- Analyze project structure and suggest reorganization
- Identify misplaced files based on naming conventions
- Detect duplicate or obsolete files
- Enforce project folder structure standards
- Archive old/unused files to appropriate locations
- Generate and maintain file inventory/documentation
- Suggest `.gitignore` updates based on file analysis
- Clean up temporary files and build artifacts
- Organize documentation by topic/module

**Use Cases:**
- Project cleanup after major refactoring
- Periodic maintenance tasks
- Enforcing project structure standards
- Preparing for code reviews or releases
- Onboarding documentation generation

**Rules Engine:**
- Configurable rules for file placement
- Pattern matching for file types
- Age-based archival policies
- Size-based cleanup thresholds

**Integration Points:**
- Work with existing `docs/` structure
- Respect `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`
- Update `CLAUDE.md` with organization changes
- Generate reports in `docs/` folder

## Notes

- Both agents should follow the established agent patterns in `.claude/agents/`
- Should integrate with existing workflow automation
- Must respect project conventions in `CLAUDE.md`
- Should provide detailed logging and reporting
- Consider making them available via slash commands (e.g., `/merge-worktrees`, `/organize-files`)
